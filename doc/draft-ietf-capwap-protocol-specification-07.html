Abstract

   This specification defines the Control And Provisioning of Wireless
   Access Points (CAPWAP) Protocol.  The CAPWAP protocol meets the IETF
   CAPWAP working group protocol requirements.  The CAPWAP protocol is
   designed to be flexible, allowing it to be used for a variety of
   wireless technologies.  This document describes the base CAPWAP
   protocol.  The CAPWAP protocol binding which defines extensions for
   use with the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN protocol is available in [<a href="#ref-12" title="&quot;CAPWAP Protocol Binding for IEEE 802.11&quot;">12</a>].
   Extensions are expected to be defined to enable use of the CAPWAP
   protocol with additional wireless technologies.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document describes the CAPWAP Protocol, a standard,
   interoperable protocol which enables an Access Controller (AC) to
   manage a collection of Wireless Termination Points (WTPs).  The
   CAPWAP protocol is defined to be independent of layer 2 technology.

   The emergence of centralized IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network
   (WLAN) architectures, in which simple IEEE 802.11 WTPs are managed by
   an Access Controller (AC) suggested that a standards based,
   interoperable protocol could radically simplify the deployment and
   management of wireless networks.  WTPs require a set of dynamic
   management and control functions related to their primary task of
   connecting the wireless and wired mediums.  Traditional protocols for
   managing WTPs are either manual static configuration via HTTP,
   proprietary Layer 2 specific or non-existent (if the WTPs are self-
   contained).  An IEEE 802.11 binding is defined in [<a href="#ref-12" title="&quot;CAPWAP Protocol Binding for IEEE 802.11&quot;">12</a>] to support use
   of the CAPWAP protocol with IEEE 802.11 WLAN networks.

   CAPWAP assumes a network configuration consisting of multiple WTPs
   communicating via the Internet Protocol (IP) to an AC.  WTPs are
   viewed as remote RF interfaces controlled by the AC.  The CAPWAP
   protocol supports two modes of operation: Split and Local MAC.  In
   Split MAC mode all L2 wireless data and management frames are
   encapsulated via the CAPWAP protocol and exchanged between the AC and
   the WTP.  As shown in Figure 1, the wireless frames received from a
   mobile device, which is referred to in this specification as a
   Station (STA), are directly encapsulated by the WTP and forwarded to
   the AC.

        Figure 1: Representative CAPWAP Architecture for Split MAC

   The Local MAC mode of operation allows for the data frames to be
   either locally bridged, or tunneled as 802.3 frames.  The latter
   implies that the WTP performs the 802 bridging function.  In either
   case the L2 wireless management frames are processed locally by the
   WTP, and then forwarded to the AC.  Figure 2 shows the Local MAC
   mode, in which a station transmits a wireless frame which is
   encapsulated in an 802.3 frame and forwarded to the AC.

        Figure 2: Representative CAPWAP Architecture for Local MAC

   Provisioning WTPs with security credentials, and managing which WTPs
   are authorized to provide service are traditionally handled by
   proprietary solutions.  Allowing these functions to be performed from
   a centralized AC in an interoperable fashion increases manageability
   and allows network operators to more tightly control their wireless
   network infrastructure.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Goals</span>

   The goals for the CAPWAP protocol are listed below:

   1. To centralize the authentication and policy enforcement functions
      for a wireless network.  The AC may also provide centralized
      bridging, forwarding, and encryption of user traffic.
      Centralization of these functions will enable reduced cost and
      higher efficiency by applying the capabilities of network
      processing silicon to the wireless network, as in wired LANs.

   2. To enable shifting of the higher level protocol processing from
      the WTP.  This leaves the time critical applications of wireless
      control and access in the WTP, making efficient use of the
      computing power available in WTPs which are the subject to severe
      cost pressure.

   3. To provide a generic encapsulation and transport mechanism,
      enabling the CAPWAP protocol to be applied to many access point
      types in the future, via a specific wireless binding.

   The CAPWAP protocol concerns itself solely with the interface between
   the WTP and the AC.  Inter-AC and station-to AC-communication are
   strictly outside the scope of this document.

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft        CAPWAP Protocol Specification            June 2007</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Protocol Overview</span>

   The CAPWAP protocol is a generic protocol defining AC and WTP control
   and data plane communication via a CAPWAP protocol transport
   mechanism.  CAPWAP control messages, and optionally CAPWAP data
   messages, are secured using Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
   [<a href="#ref-7" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1&quot;">7</a>].  DTLS is a standards-track IETF protocol based upon TLS.  The
   underlying security-related protocol mechanisms of TLS have been
   successfully deployed for many years.

   The CAPWAP protocol Transport layer carries two types of payload,
   CAPWAP Data messages and CAPWAP Control messages.  CAPWAP Data
   messages encapsulate forwarded wireless frames.  CAPWAP protocol
   Control messages are management messages exchanged between a WTP and
   an AC.  The CAPWAP Data and Control packets are sent over separate
   UDP ports.  Since both data and control packets can exceed the
   Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) length, the payload of a CAPWAP data
   or control message can be fragmented.  The fragmentation behavior is
   defined in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

   The CAPWAP Protocol begins with a discovery phase.  The WTPs send a
   Discovery Request message, causing any Access Controller (AC)
   receiving the message to respond with a Discovery Response message.
   From the Discovery Response messages received, a WTP selects an AC
   with which to establish a secure DTLS session.  CAPWAP protocol
   messages will be fragmented to the maximum length discovered to be
   supported by the network.

   Once the WTP and the AC have completed DTLS session establishment, a
   configuration exchange occurs in which both devices agree on version
   information.  During this exchange the WTP may receive provisioning
   settings.  The WTP is then enabled for operation.

   When the WTP and AC have completed the version and provision exchange
   and the WTP is enabled, the CAPWAP protocol is used to encapsulate
   the wireless data frames sent between the WTP and AC.  The CAPWAP
   protocol will fragment the L2 frames if the size of the encapsulated
   wireless user data (Data) or protocol control (Management) frames
   causes the resulting CAPWAP protocol packet to exceed the MTU
   supported between the WTP and AC.  Fragmented CAPWAP packets are
   reassembled to reconstitute the original encapsulated payload.

   The CAPWAP protocol provides for the delivery of commands from the AC
   to the WTP for the management of stations that are communicating with
   the WTP.  This may include the creation of local data structures in
   the WTP for the stations and the collection of statistical
   information about the communication between the WTP and the stations.
   The CAPWAP protocol provides a mechanism for the AC to obtain

</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-9" id="page-9" href="#page-9" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey">Internet-Draft        CAPWAP Protocol Specification            June 2007</span>


   statistical information collected by the WTP.

   The CAPWAP protocol provides for a keep alive feature that preserves
   the communication channel between the WTP and AC.  If the AC fails to
   appear alive, the WTP will try to discover a new AC.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-2.1" href="#section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Wireless Binding Definition</span>

   The CAPWAP protocol is independent of a specific WTP radio
   technology.  Elements of the CAPWAP protocol are designed to
   accommodate the specific needs of each wireless technology in a
   standard way.  Implementation of the CAPWAP protocol for a particular
   wireless technology MUST follow the binding requirements defined for
   that technology.

   When defining a binding for wireless technologies, the authors MUST
   include any necessary definitions for technology-specific messages
   and all technology-specific message elements for those messages.  At
   a minimum, a binding MUST provide:

   1 -   The definition for a binding-specific Statistics message
      element, carried in the WTP Event Request message

   2 -   A message element carried in the Station Configuration Request
      message to configure station information on the WTP

   3 -   A WTP Radio Information message element carried in the
      Discovery, Primary Discovery and Join Request and Response
      messages, indicating the binding specific radio types supported at
      the WTP and AC.

   If technology specific message elements are required for any of the
   existing CAPWAP messages defined in this specification, they MUST
   also be defined in the technology binding document.

   The naming of binding-specific message elements MUST begin with the
   name of the technology type, e.g., the binding for IEEE 802.11,
   provided in [<a href="#ref-12" title="&quot;CAPWAP Protocol Binding for IEEE 802.11&quot;">12</a>], begins with "IEEE 802.11".

   The CAPWAP binding concept is also used in any future specifications
   that add functionality to either the base CAPWAP protocol
   specification, or any published CAPWAP binding specification.  A
   separate WTP Radio Information message element MUST be created to
   properly advertise support for the specification.  This mechanism
   allows for future protocol extensibility, while providing the
   necessary capabilities advertisement, through the WTP Radio
   Information message element, to ensure WTP/AC interoperability.

   The following state diagram represents the lifecycle of a WTP-AC
   session.  Use of DTLS by the CAPWAP protocol results in the
   juxtaposition of two nominally separate yet tightly bound state
   machines.  The DTLS and CAPWAP state machines are coupled through an
   API consisting of commands (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.1">Section 2.3.2.1</a>) and notifications
   (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>).  Certain transitions in the DTLS state machine
   are triggered by commands from the CAPWAP state machine, while
   certain transitions in the CAPWAP state machine are triggered by
   notifications from the DTLS state machine.

   The CAPWAP protocol state machine, depicted above, is used by both
   the AC and the WTP.  In cases where states are not shared (i.e. not
   implemented in one or the other of the AC or WTP), this is explicitly
   called out in the transition descriptions below.  For every state
   defined, only certain messages are permitted to be sent and received.
   The CAPWAP control messages definitions specify the state(s) in which

   each message is valid.

   Since the WTP only communicates with a single AC, it only has a
   single instance of the CAPWAP state machine.  The AC has a separate
   instance of the CAPWAP state machine per WTP it is communicating
   with.

         first Discovery Request message (see <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>).  Upon
         entering this state, the WTP sets the DiscoveryInterval timer
         (see <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>).  The WTP resets the DiscoveryCount counter
         to zero (0) (see <a href="#section-4.8">Section 4.8</a>).  The WTP also clears all
         information from ACs it may have received during a previous
         Discovery phase.

      AC:  The AC does not maintain state information for the WTP upon
         reception of the Discovery Request message, but it SHOULD
         respond with a Discovery Response message (see <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>).
         This transition is a no-op for the AC.

   Idle to Sulking (b):  This transition occurs to force the WTP and AC
      to enter a quiet period to avoid repeatedly attempting to
      establish a connection.

      WTP:  The WTP enters this state when the FailedDTLSSessionCount or
         the FailedDTLSAuthFailCount counter reaches
         MaxFailedDTLSSessionRetry variable (see <a href="#section-4.8">Section 4.8</a>).  Upon
         entering this state, the WTP MUST start the SilentInterval
         timer.  While in the Sulking state, all received CAPWAP and
         DTLS protocol messages received MUST be ignored.

      AC:  The AC enters this state with the specific WTP when the
         FailedDTLSSessionCount or the FailedDTLSAuthFailCount counter
         reaches MaxFailedDTLSSessionRetry variable (see <a href="#section-4.8">Section 4.8</a>).
         Upon entering this state, the AC MUST start the SilentInterval
         timer.  While in the Sulking state, all received CAPWAP and
         DTLS protocol messages received from the WTP MUST be ignored.

   Discovery to Discovery (2):  In the Discovery state, the WTP
      determines which AC to connect to.

      WTP:  This transition occurs when the DiscoveryInterval timer
         expires.  If the WTP is configured with a list of ACs, it
         transmits a Discovery Request message to every AC from which it
         has not received a Discovery Response message.  For every
         transition to this event, the WTP increments the DiscoveryCount
         counter.  See <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a> for more information on how the WTP
         knows the ACs to which it should transmit the Discovery Request
         messages.  The WTP restarts the DiscoveryInterval timer
         whenever it transmits Discovery Request messages.

      AC:  This is a no-op.

   Discovery to Sulking (c):  This transition occurs on a WTP when
      Discovery or connectivity to the AC fails.

      WTP:  The WTP enters this state when the DiscoveryInterval timer
         expires or the DiscoveryCount variable is equal to the
         MaxDiscoveries variable (see <a href="#section-4.8">Section 4.8</a>).  Upon entering this
         state, the WTP MUST start the SilentInterval timer.  While in
         the Sulking state, all received CAPWAP protocol messages
         received MUST be ignored.

      AC:  This is a no-op.

   Sulking to Idle (d):  This transition occurs on a WTP when it must
      restart the discovery phase.

      WTP:  The WTP enters this state when the SilentInterval timer (see
         <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>) expires.  The FailedDTLSSessionCount,
         DiscoveryCount and FailedDTLSAuthFailCount counters are reset
         to zero.

      AC:  The AC enters this state when the SilentInterval timer (see
         <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>) expires.  The FailedDTLSSessionCount,
         DiscoveryCount and FailedDTLSAuthFailCount counters are reset
         to zero.

   Sulking to Sulking (3):  The Sulking state provides the silent
      period, minimizing the possibility for Denial of Service (DoS)
      attacks.

      WTP:  All packets received from the AC while in the sulking state
         are ignored.

      AC:  All packets receive from the WTP while in the sulking state
         are ignored.

   Idle to DTLS Setup (e):  This transition occurs to establish a secure
      DTLS session with the peer.

      WTP:  The WTP initiates this transition by invoking the DTLSStart
         command, which starts the DTLS session establishment with the
         chosen AC.  When the discovery phase is bypassed, it is assumed
         the WTP has a locally configured AC.

      AC:  The AC initiates this transition by invoking the DTLSListen
         command, which informs the DTLS stack that it is willing to
         listen for an incoming session.  The AC MAY provide optional
         qualifiers in the DTLSListen command to only accept session
         requests from specific WTPs.

   Discovery to DTLS Setup (f):  This transition occurs to establish a
      secure DTLS session with the peer.

      WTP:  The WTP initiates this transition by invoking the DTLSStart
         command (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.1">Section 2.3.2.1</a>), which starts the DTLS session
         establishment with the chosen AC.  The decision of which AC to
         connect to is the result of the discovery phase, which is
         described in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>.

      AC:  The AC initiates this transition by invoking the DTLSListen
         command (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.1">Section 2.3.2.1</a>), which informs the DTLS stack
         that it is willing to listen for an incoming session.  The AC
         MAY have maintained state information when it received the
         Discovery Request message to provide optional qualifiers in the
         DTLSListen command to only accept session requests from a
         specific WTP.  Note that maintaining state information based on
         an unsecured Discovery Request message MAY lead to a Denial of
         Service attack.  Therefore the AC SHOULD ensure that the state
         information is freed after a period, which is implementation
         specific.

   DTLS Setup to Idle (g):  This transition occurs when the DTLS Session
      failed to be established.

      WTP:  The WTP initiates this state transition when it receives a
         DTLSEstablishFail notification from DTLS (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>).
         This error notification aborts the secure DTLS session
         establishment.  When this notification is received, the
         FailedDTLSSessionCount counter is incremented.

      AC:  The WTP initiates this state transition when it receives a
         DTLSEstablishFail notification from DTLS (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>).
         This error notification aborts the secure DTLS session
         establishment.  When this notification is received, the
         FailedDTLSSessionCount counter is incremented.

   DTLS Setup to Authorize (h):  This transition occurs when an incoming
      DTLS session is being established, and the DTLS stack needs
      authorization to proceed with the session establishment.

      WTP:  This state transition occurs when the WTP receives the
         DTLSPeerAuthorize notification (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>).  Upon
         entering this state, the WTP performs an authorization check
         against the AC credentials.  See <a href="#section-2.4.4">Section 2.4.4</a> for more
         information on AC authorization.

      AC:  This state transition occurs when the AC receives the
         DTLSPeerAuthorize notification (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>).  Upon
         entering this state, the AC performs an authorization check
         against the WTP credentials.  See <a href="#section-2.4.4">Section 2.4.4</a> for more
         information on WTP authorization.

   Authorize to DTLS Connect (j):  This transition occurs to notify the
      DTLS stack that the session should be established.

      WTP:  This state transition occurs when the WTP has either opted
         to forgo the authorization check of the AC's credentials, or
         the credentials were successfully authorized.  This is done by
         invoking the DTLSAccept DTLS command (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.1">Section 2.3.2.1</a>).

      AC:  This state transition occurs when the AC has either opted to
         forgo the authorization check of the WTP's credentials, or the
         credentials were successfully authorized.  This is done by
         invoking the DTLSAccept DTLS command (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.1">Section 2.3.2.1</a>).

   Authorize to DTLS Teardown (k):  This transition occurs to notify the
      DTLS stack that the session should be aborted.

      WTP:  This state transition occurs when the WTP was unable to
         authorize the AC, using the AC credentials.  The WTP then
         aborts the DTLS session by invoking the DTLSAbortSession
         command (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.1">Section 2.3.2.1</a>).

      AC:  This state transition occurs when the AC was unable to
         authorize the WTP, using the WTP credentials.  The AC then
         aborts the DTLS session by invoking the DTLSAbortSession
         command (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.1">Section 2.3.2.1</a>).

   DTLS Connect to Idle (m):  This transition occurs when the DTLS
      Session failed to be established.

      WTP:  This state transition occurs when the WTP receives either a
         DTLSAborted or DTLSAuthenticateFail notification (see
         <a href="#section-2.3.2.2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>), indicating that the DTLS session was not
         successfully established.  When this transition occurs due to
         the DTLSAuthenticateFail notification, the
         FailedDTLSAuthFailCount is incremented, otherwise the
         FailedDTLSSessionCount counter is incremented.

      AC:  This state transition occurs when the AC receives either a
         DTLSAborted or DTLSAuthenticateFail notification (see
         <a href="#section-2.3.2.2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>), indicating that the DTLS session was not
         successfully established.  When this transition occurs due to
         the DTLSAuthenticateFail notification, the
         FailedDTLSAuthFailCount is incremented, otherwise the
         FailedDTLSSessionCount counter is incremented.

   DTLS Connect to Join (n):  This transition occurs when the DTLS
      Session is successfully established.

      WTP:  This state transition occurs when the WTP receives the
         DTLSEstablished notification (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>), indicating
         that the DTLS session was successfully established.  When this
         notification is received, the FailedDTLSSessionCount counter is
         set to zero.

      AC:  This state transition occurs when the AC receives the
         DTLSEstablished notification (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>), indicating
         that the DTLS session was successfully established.  When this
         notification is received, the FailedDTLSSessionCount counter is
         set to zero, and the WaitJoin timer is started (see
         <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>).

   Join to DTLS Teardown (p):  This transition occurs when the join
      process failed.

      WTP:  This state transition occurs when the WTP receives a Join
         Response message with a Result Code message element containing
         an error, if the Image Identifier provided by the AC in the
         Join Response message differs from the WTP's currently running
         firmware version and the WTP has the requested image in its
         non-volatile memory, or if the WaitDTLS timer expires.  This
         causes the WTP to initiate the DTLSShutdown command (see
         <a href="#section-2.3.2.1">Section 2.3.2.1</a>).  This transition also occurs if the WTP
         receives one of the following DTLS notifications: DTLSAborted,
         DTLSReassemblyFailure or DTLSPeerDisconnect.

      AC:  This state transition occurs either if the WaitJoin timer
         expires or if the AC transmits a Join Response message with a
         Result Code message element containing an error.  This causes
         the AC to initiate the DTLSShutdown command (see
         <a href="#section-2.3.2.1">Section 2.3.2.1</a>).  This transition also occurs if the AC
         receives one of the following DTLS notifications: DTLSAborted,
         DTLSReassemblyFailure or DTLSPeerDisconnect.

   Join to Image Data (r):  This state transition is used by the WTP and
      the AC to download executable firmware.

      WTP:  The WTP enters the Image Data state when it receives a
         successful Join Response message and determines and the
         included Image Identifier message element is not the same as
         its currently running image.  The WTP also detects that the
         requested image version is not currently available in the WTP's
         non-volatile storage (see <a href="#section-9.1">Section 9.1</a> for a full description of
         the firmware download process).  The WTP initializes the
         EchoInterval timer (see <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>), and transmits the Image
         Data Request message (see <a href="#section-9.1.1">Section 9.1.1</a>) requesting the start
         of the firmware download.

      AC:  This state transition occurs when the AC receives the Image
         Data Request message from the WTP.  The AC MUST transmit an
         Image Data Response message (see <a href="#section-9.1.2">Section 9.1.2</a>) to the WTP,
         which includes a portion of the firmware.  The AC MUST start
         the NeighborDeadInterval timer (see <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>).

   Join to Configure (q):  This state transition is used by the WTP and
      the AC to exchange configuration information.

      WTP:  The WTP enters the Configure state when it receives a
         successful Join Response, and determines that the included
         Image Identifier message element is the same as its currently
         running image.  The WTP transmits the Configuration Status
         message (see <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>) to the AC with message elements
         describing its current configuration.  The WTP also starts the
         ResponseTimeout timer (see <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>).

      AC:  This state transition occurs immediately after the AC
         transmits the Join Response message to the WTP.  If the AC
         receives the Configuration Status message from the WTP, the AC
         MUST transmit a Configuration Status Response message (see
         <a href="#section-8.3">Section 8.3</a>) to the WTP, and MAY include specific message
         elements to override the WTP's configuration.  The WTP also
         starts the ChangeStatePendingTimer timer (see <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>).

   Configure to Reset (s):  This state transition is used to reset the
      connection either due to an error during the configuration phase,
      or when the WTP determines it needs to reset in order for the new
      configuration to take effect.

      WTP:  The WTP enters the Reset state when it receives a
         Configuration Status Response indicating an error or when it
         determines that a reset of the WTP is required, due to the
         characteristics of a new configuration.

      AC:  The AC transitions to the Reset state when it receives a
         Change State Event message from the WTP that contains an error
         for which AC policy does not permit the WTP to provide service.
         This state transition also occurs when the AC
         ChangeStatePendingTimer timer expires.

   Configure to DTLS Teardown (V):  This transition occurs when the
      configuration process aborts due to a DTLS error.

      WTP:  The WTP enters this state when it receives one of the
         following DTLS notifications: DTLSAborted,
         DTLSReassemblyFailure or DTLSPeerDisconnect (see
         <a href="#section-2.3.2.2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>).  The WTP MAY tear down the DTLS session if it
         receives frequent DTLSDecapFailure notifications.

      AC:  The AC enters this state when it receives one of the
         following DTLS notifications: DTLSAborted,
         DTLSReassemblyFailure or DTLSPeerDisconnect (see
         <a href="#section-2.3.2.2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>).  The WTP MAY tear down the DTLS session if it
         receives frequent DTLSDecapFailure notifications.

   Image Data to Image Data (4):  The Image Data state is used by the
      WTP and the AC during the firmware download phase.

      WTP:  The WTP enters the Image Data state when it receives an
         Image Data Response message indicating that the AC has more
         data to send.

      AC:  This state transition occurs when the AC receives the Image
         Data Request message from the WTP while already in the Image
         Data state, and it detects that the firmware download has not
         completed.

   Image Data to Reset (o):  This state transition is used to reset the
      DTLS connection prior to restarting the WTP after an image
      download.

      WTP:  When an image download completes, the WTP enters the Reset
         state.  The WTP MAY also transition to this state upon
         receiving an Image Data Response message from the AC (see
         <a href="#section-9.1.2">Section 9.1.2</a>) indicating a failure.

      AC:  The AC enters the Reset state when the image download is
         complete, or if an error occurs during the image download
         process.

   Image Data to DTLS Teardown (x):  This transition occurs when the
      firmware download process aborts due to a DTLS error.

      WTP:  The WTP enters this state when it receives one of the
         following DTLS notifications: DTLSAborted,
         DTLSReassemblyFailure or DTLSPeerDisconnect (see
         <a href="#section-2.3.2.2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>).  The WTP MAY tear down the DTLS session if it
         receives frequent DTLSDecapFailure notifications.

      AC:  The AC enters this state when it receives one of the
         following DTLS notifications: DTLSAborted,
         DTLSReassemblyFailure or DTLSPeerDisconnect (see
         <a href="#section-2.3.2.2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>).  The WTP MAY tear down the DTLS session if it
         receives frequent DTLSDecapFailure notifications.

   Configure to Data Check (t):  This state transition occurs when the
      WTP and AC confirm the configuration.

      WTP:  The WTP enters this state when it receives a successful
         Configuration Status Response message from the AC.  The WTP
         initializes the EchoInterval timer (see <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>), and
         transmits the Change State Event Request message (see
         <a href="#section-8.6">Section 8.6</a>).

      AC:  This state transition occurs when the AC receives the Change
         State Event Request message (see <a href="#section-8.6">Section 8.6</a>) from the WTP.
         The AC responds with a Change State Event Response message (see
         <a href="#section-8.7">Section 8.7</a>).  The AC MUST start the NeighborDeadInterval timer
         (see <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>).

   Data Check to Run (u):  This state transition occurs when the linkage
      between the control and data channels has occured, causing the WTP
      and AC to enter their normal state of operation.

      WTP:  The WTP enters this state when it receives a successful
         Change State Event Response message from the AC.  The WTP
         initiates the data channel, which MAY require the establishment
         of a DTLS session, starts the DataChannelKeepAlive timer (see

      AC:  This state transition occurs when the AC receives the Data
         Channel Keep Alive packet (see <a href="#section-4.4.1">Section 4.4.1</a>), with a Session
         ID message element matching that included by the WTP in the
         Join Request message.  Note that if AC policy is to require the
         data channel to be encrypted, this process would also require
         the establishment of a data channel DTLS session.  Upon
         receiving the Data Channel Keep Alive packet, the AC transmits
         its own Data Channel Keep Alive packet.

   Run to DTLS Teardown (u):  This state transition occurs when an error
      has occured in the DTLS stack, causing the DTLS session to be
      torndown.

      WTP:  The WTP enters this state when it receives one of the
         following DTLS notifications: DTLSAborted,
         DTLSReassemblyFailure or DTLSPeerDisconnect (see
         <a href="#section-2.3.2.2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>).  The WTP MAY tear down the DTLS session if it
         receives frequent DTLSDecapFailure notifications.  The WTP also
         transitions to this state if the underlying reliable
         transport's RetransmitCount counter has reached the
         MaxRetransmit variable (see <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>).

      AC:  The AC enters this state when it receives one of the
         following DTLS notifications: DTLSAborted,
         DTLSReassemblyFailure or DTLSPeerDisconnect (see
         <a href="#section-2.3.2.2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>).  The WTP MAY tear down the DTLS session if it
         receives frequent DTLSDecapFailure notifications.  The AC
         transitions to this state if the underlying reliable
         transport's RetransmitCount counter has reached the
         MaxRetransmit variable (see <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>).

   Run to Run (5):  This is the normal state of operation.

      WTP:  This is the WTP's normal state of operation.  There are many
         events that result this state transition:

         Configuration Update:  The WTP receives a Configuration Update
            Request message(see <a href="#section-8.4">Section 8.4</a>).  The WTP MUST respond with
            a Configuration Update Response message (see <a href="#section-8.5">Section 8.5</a>).

         Change State Event:  The WTP receives a Change State Event
            Response message, or determines that it must initiate a
            Change State Event Request message, as a result of a failure
            or change in the state of a radio.

   Run to Reset (x):  This state transition is used when either the AC
      or WTP tear down the connection.  This may occur as part of normal
      operation, or due to error conditions.

      WTP:  The WTP enters the Reset state when it receives a Reset
         Request message from the AC.

      AC:  The AC enters the Reset state when it transmits a Reset
         Request message to the WTP.

   Reset to DTLS Teardown (y):  This transition occurs when the CAPWAP
      reset is complete, to terminate the DTLS session.

      WTP:  This state transition occurs when the WTP receives a Reset
         Response message.  This causes the WTP to initiate the
         DTLSShutdown command (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.1">Section 2.3.2.1</a>).

      AC:  This state transition occurs when the AC transmits a Reset
         Response message.  The AC does not invoke the DTLSShutdown

   DTLS Teardown to Idle (z):  This transition occurs when the DTLS
      session has been shutdown.

      WTP:  This state transition occurs when the WTP has successfully
         cleaned up all resources associated with the control plane DTLS
         session.  The data plane DTLS session is also shutdown, and all

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-2.3.2" href="#section-2.3.2">2.3.2</a>.  CAPWAP/DTLS Interface</span>

   This section describes the DTLS Commands used by CAPWAP, and the
   notifications received from DTLS to the CAPWAP protocol stack.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-2.3.2.1" href="#section-2.3.2.1">2.3.2.1</a>.  CAPWAP to DTLS Commands</span>

   Six commands are defined for the CAPWAP to DTLS API.  These
   "commands" are conceptual, and may be implemented as one or more
   function calls.  This API definition is provided to clarify
   interactions between the DTLS and CAPWAP components of the integrated
   CAPWAP state machine.

   Below is a list of the minimal command API:

   o  DTLSStart is sent to the DTLS component to cause a DTLS session to
      be established.  Upon invoking the DTLSStart command, the WaitDTLS
      timer is started.  The WTP initiates this DTLS command, as the AC
      does not initiate DTLS sessions.

   o  DTLSListen is sent to the DTLS component to allow the DTLS
      component to listen for incoming DTLS session requests.

   o  DTLSAccept is sent to the DTLS component to allow the DTLS session
      establishment to continue successfully.

   o  DTLSAbortSession is sent to the DTLS component to cause the
      session that is in the process of being established to be aborted.
      This command is also sent when the WaitDTLS timer expires.  When
      this command is executed, the FailedDTLSSessionCount counter is
      incremented.

   o  DTLSShutdown is sent to the DTLS component to cause session
      teardown.

   o  DTLSMtuUpdate is sent by the CAPWAP component to modify the MTU
      size used by the DTLS component.  The default size is 1468 bytes.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-2.3.2.2" href="#section-2.3.2.2">2.3.2.2</a>.  DTLS to CAPWAP Notifications</span>

   DTLS notifications are defined for the DTLS to CAPWAP API.  These
   "notifications" are conceptual, and may be implemented in numerous
   ways (e.g. as function return values).  This API definition is
   provided to clarify interactions between the DTLS and CAPWAP
   components of the integrated CAPWAP state machine.  It is important
   to note that the notifications listed below MAY cause the CAPWAP
   state machine to jump from one state to another using a state
   transition not listed in <a href="#section-2.3.1">Section 2.3.1</a>.  When a notification listed

   below occurs, the target CAPWAP state shown in Figure 3 becomes the
   current state.

   Below is a list of the API notifications:

   o  DTLSPeerAuthorize is sent to the CAPWAP component during DTLS
      session establishment once the peer's identity has been received.
      This notification MAY be used by the CAPWAP component to authorize
      the session, based on the peer's identity.  The authorization
      process will lead to the CAPWAP component initiating either the
      DTLSAccept or DTLSAbortSession commands.

   o  DTLSEstablished is sent to the CAPWAP component to indicate that
      that a secure channel now exists, using the parameters provided
      during the DTLS initialization process.  When this notification is
      received, the FailedDTLSSessionCount counter is reset to zero.
      When this notification is received, the WaitDTLS timer is stopped.

   o  DTLSEstablishFail is sent when the DTLS session establishment has
      failed, either due to a local error, or due to the peer rejecting
      the session establishment.  When this notification is received,
      the FailedDTLSSessionCount counter is incremented.

   o  DTLSAuthenticateFail is sent when DTLS session establishment
      failed due to an authentication error.  When this notification is
      received, the FailedDTLSAuthFailCount counter is incremented.

   o  DTLSAborted is sent to the CAPWAP component to indicate that
      session abort (as requested by CAPWAP) is complete; this occurs to
      confirm a DTLS session abort, or when the WaitDTLS timer expires.
      When this notification is received, the WaitDTLS timer is stopped.

   o  DTLSReassemblyFailure MAY be sent to the CAPWAP component to
      indicate DTLS fragment reassembly failure.

   o  DTLSDecapFailure MAY be sent to the CAPWAP module to indicate a
      decapsulation failure.  DTLSDecapFailure MAY be sent to the CAPWAP
      module to indicate an encryption/authentication failure.  This
      notification is intended for informative purposes only, and is not
      intended to cause a change in the CAPWAP state machine (see
      <a href="#section-12.4">Section 12.4</a>).

   o  DTLSPeerDisconnect is sent to the CAPWAP component to indicate the
      DTLS session has been torn down.  Note that this notification is
      only received if the DTLS session has been established.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-2.4" href="#section-2.4">2.4</a>.  Use of DTLS in the CAPWAP Protocol</span>

   DTLS is used as a tightly-integrated, secure wrapper for the CAPWAP
   protocol.  In this document DTLS and CAPWAP are discussed as
   nominally distinct entitites; however they are very closely coupled,
   and may even be implemented inseparably.  Since there are DTLS
   library implementations currently available, and since security
   protocols (e.g.  IPsec, TLS) are often implemented in widely
   available acceleration hardware, it is both convenient and forward-
   looking to maintain a modular distinction in this document.

   This section describes a detailed walk-through of the interactions
   between the DTLS module and the CAPWAP module, via 'commands' (CAPWAP
   to DTLS) and 'notifications' (DTLS to CAPWAP) as they would be
   encountered during the normal course of operation.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-2.4.1" href="#section-2.4.1">2.4.1</a>.  DTLS Handshake Processing</span>

   Details of the DTLS handshake process are specified in [<a href="#ref-8" title="&quot;Datagram Transport Layer Security&quot;">8</a>].  This
   section describes the interactions between the DTLS session
   establishment process and the CAPWAP protocol.  Note that the
   conceptual DTLS state is shown below to help understand the point at
   which the DTLS states transition.  In the normal case, the DTLS
   handshake will proceed as follows (NOTE: this example uses
   certificates, but preshared keys are also supported):

   DTLS, as specified, provides its own retransmit timers with an
   exponential back-off.  However, DTLS will never terminate the
   handshake due to non-responsiveness; instead, DTLS will continue to
   increase its back-off timer period.  Hence, timing out incomplete
   DTLS handshakes is entirely the responsiblity of the CAPWAP module.

   The DTLS implementation used by CAPWAP MUST support TLS Session
   Resumption.  Session resumption is used to establish the DTLS session
   used for the data channel.  The DTLS implementation on the WTP MUST
   return some unique identifier to the CAPWAP module to enable
   subsequent establishment of a DTLS-encrypted data channel, if
   necessary.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-2.4.2" href="#section-2.4.2">2.4.2</a>.  DTLS Session Establishment</span>

   The WTP, either through the Discovery process, or through pre-
   configuration, determines the AC to connect to.  The WTP uses the
   DTLSStart command to request that a secure connection be established
   to the selected AC.  Prior to initiation of the DTLS handshake, the

</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-29" id="page-29" href="#page-29" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey">Internet-Draft        CAPWAP Protocol Specification            June 2007</span>


   WTP sets the WaitDTLS timer.  Upon receiving the DTLSPeerAuthorize
   DTLS notification, the AC sets the WaitDTLS timer.  If the
   DTLSEstablished notification is not received prior to timer
   expiration, the DTLS session is aborted by issuing the
   DTLSAbortSession DTLS command.  This notification causes the CAPWAP
   module to transition to the Idle state.  Upon receiving a
   DTLSEstablished notification, the WaitDTLS timer is deactivated.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-2.4.3" href="#section-2.4.3">2.4.3</a>.  DTLS Error Handling</span>

   If the AC does not respond to any DTLS messages sent by the WTP, the
   DTLS specification calls for the WTP to retransmit these messages.
   If the WaitDTLS timer expires, CAPWAP will issue the DTLSAbortSession
   command, causing DTLS to terminate the handshake and remove any
   allocated session context.  Note that DTLS MAY send a single TLS
   Alert message to the AC to indicate session termination.

   If the WTP does not respond to any DTLS messages sent by the AC, the
   CAPWAP protocol allows for three possiblities, listed below.  Note
   that DTLS MAY send a single TLS Alert message to the AC to indicate
   session termination.

   o  The message was lost in transit; in this case, the WTP will re-
      transmit its last outstanding message, since it did not receive a
      reply.

   o  The WTP sent a DTLS Alert, which was lost in transit; in this
      case, the AC's WaitDTLS timer will expire, and the session will be
      terminated.

   o  Communication with the WTP has completely failed; in this case,
      the AC's WaitDTLS timer will expire, and the session will be
      terminated.

   The DTLS specification provides for retransmission of unacknowledged
   requests.  If retransmissions remain unacknowledged, the WaitDTLS
   timer will eventually expire, at which time the CAPWAP component will
   terminate the session.

   If a cookie fails to validate, this could represent a WTP error, or
   it could represent a DoS attack.  Hence, AC resource utilization
   SHOULD be minimized.  The AC MAY log a message indicating the
   failure, but SHOULD NOT attempt to reply to the WTP.

   Since DTLS handshake messages are potentially larger than the maximum
   record size, DTLS supports fragmenting of handshake messages across
   multiple records.  There are several potential causes of re-assembly
   errors, including overlapping and/or lost fragments.  The DTLS

   component MUST send a DTLSReassemblyFailure notification to the
   CAPWAP component.  Whether precise information is given along with
   notification is an implementation issue, and hence is beyond the
   scope of this document.  Upon receipt of such an error, the CAPWAP
   component SHOULD log an appropriate error message.  Whether
   processing continues or the DTLS session is terminated is
   implementation dependent.

   DTLS decapsulation errors consist of three types: decryption errors,
   authentication errors, and malformed DTLS record headers.  Since DTLS
   authenticates the data prior to encapsulation, if decryption fails,
   it is difficult to detect this without first attempting to
   authenticate the packet.  If authentication fails, a decryption error
   is also likely, but not guaranteed.  Rather than attempt to derive
   (and require the implementation of) algorithms for detecting
   decryption failures, decryption failures are reported as
   authentication failures.  The DTLS component MUST provide a
   DTLSDecapFailure notification to the CAPWAP component when such
   errors occur.  If a malformed DTLS record header is detected, the
   packets SHOULD be silently discarded, and the receiver MAY log an
   error message.

   There is currently only one encapsulation error defined: MTU
   exceeded.  As part of DTLS session establishment, the CAPWAP
   component informs the DTLS component of the MTU size.  This may be
   dynamically modified at any time when the CAPWAP component sends the
   DTLSMtuUpdate command to the DTLS component (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.1">Section 2.3.2.1</a>).
   The DTLS component returns this notification to the CAPWAP component

   Pre-shared keys present significant challenges from a security
   perspective, and for that reason, their use is strongly discouraged.
   Several methods for authenticating with preshared keys are defined
   [<a href="#ref-6" title="&quot;Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)&quot;">6</a>], and we focus on the following two:

   o  PSK key exchange algorithm - simplest method, ciphersuites use
      only symmetric key algorithms

   o  DHE_PSK key exchange algorithm - use a PSK to authenticate a
      Diffie-Hellman exchange.  These ciphersuites give some additional
      protection against dictionary attacks and also provide Perfect
      Forward Secrecy (PFS).

   The first approach (plain PSK) is susceptible to passive dictionary
   attacks; hence, while this alorithm MUST be supported, special care
   should be taken when choosing that method.  In particular, user-
   readable passphrases SHOULD NOT be used, and use of short PSKs SHOULD
   be strongly discouraged.

   The following cryptographic algorithms MUST be supported when using
   preshared keys:

   o  TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA

   Certificate authorization by the AC and WTP is required so that only
   an AC may perform the functions of an AC and that only a WTP may
   perform the functions of a WTP.  This restriction of functions to the
   AC or WTP requires that the certificates used by the AC MUST be

   distinguishable from the certificate used by the WTP.  To accomplish
   this differentiation, the x.509 certificates MUST include the
   Extended Key Usage (EKU) certificate extension [<a href="#ref-4" title="&quot;Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile&quot;">4</a>].

   The EKU field indicates one or more purposes for which a certificate
   may be used.  It is an essential part in authorization.  Its syntax
   is as follows:

         ExtKeyUsageSyntax  ::=  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId

         KeyPurposeId  ::=  OBJECT IDENTIFIER


   Here we define two KeyPurposeId values, one for the WTP and one for
   the AC.  Inclusion of one of these two values indicates a certificate
   is authorized for use by a WTP or AC, respectively.  These values are
   formatted as id-kp fields.

             id-kp  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=
                 { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
                   security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) 3 }

              id-kp-capwapAC   OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { id-kp 18 }

              id-kp-capwapWTP  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { id-kp 19 }



   For an AC, the id-kp-capwapAC EKU MUST be present in the certificate.
   For a WTP, the id-kp-capwapWTP EKU MUST be present in the
   certificate.

   Part of the CAPWAP certificate validation process includes ensuring
   that the proper EKU is included and allowing the CAPWAP session to be
   established only if the extension properly represents the device.

   The certificate common name (CN) for both the WTP and AC MUST be the
   MAC address of that device.  The MAC address MUST be formatted as
   ASCII HEX, e.g. 01:23:45:67:89:ab.

   ACs and WTPs SHOULD authorize (e.g. through access control lists)
   certificates of devices to which they are connecting, based on the
   MAC address and organizational information specified in the O and OU
   fields.  The identities specified in the certificates bind a
   particular DTLS session to a specific pair of mutually-authenticated
   and authorized MAC addresses.

   When DTLS uses PSK Ciphersuites, the ServerKeyExchange message MUST
   contain the "PSK identity hint" field and the ClientKeyExchange
   message MUST contain the "PSK identity" field.  These fields are used
   to help the WTP select the appropriate PSK for use with the AC, and
   then indicate to the AC which key is being used.  When PSKs are
   provisioned to WTPs and ACs, both the PSK Hint and PSK Identity for
   the key MUST be specified.

   The PSK Hint SHOULD uniquely identify the AC and the PSK Identity
   SHOULD uniquely identify the WTP.  It is RECOMMENDED that these hints
   and identities be the ASCII HEX-formatted MAC addresses of the
   respective devices, since each pairwise combination of WTP and AC
   SHOULD have a unique PSK.  The PSK hint and identity SHOULD be
   sufficient to perform authorization, as simply having knowledge of a
   PSK does not necessarily imply authorization.

   If a single PSK is being used for multiple devices on a CAPWAP
   network, which is NOT RECOMMENDED, the PSK Hint and Identity can no
   longer be a MAC address, so appropriate hints and identities SHOULD
   be selected to identify the group of devices to which the PSK is
   provisioned.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  CAPWAP Transport</span>

   Communication between a WTP and an AC is established using the
   standard UDP client/server model.  The CAPWAP protocol supports both
   UDP and UDP-Lite [<a href="#ref-11" title="&quot;The Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite)&quot;">11</a>] transport protocols.  The UDP protocol is used
   with IPv4.  When CAPWAP is used over IPv6, the UDP-Lite protocol is
   used.  This section describes how the CAPWAP protocol is carried over
   IP and UDP/UDP-Lite transport protocols.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  UDP Transport</span>

   One of the CAPWAP protocol requirements is to allow a WTP to reside
   behind a firewall and/or Network Address Translation (NAT) device.
   Since a CAPWAP session is initiated by the WTP (client) to the well-
   known UDP port of the AC (server), the use of UDP is a logical
   choice.  The UDP checksum field in CAPWAP packets MUST be set to
   zero.

   CAPWAP protocol control packets sent from the WTP to the AC use the
   CAPWAP control channel, as defined in <a href="#section-1.4">Section 1.4</a>.  The CAPWAP
   control port at the AC is the well known UDP port [to be IANA
   assigned].  The CAPWAP control port at the WTP can be any port
   selected by the WTP.

   CAPWAP protocol data packets sent from the WTP to the AC use the
   CAPWAP data channel, as defined in <a href="#section-1.4">Section 1.4</a>.  The CAPWAP data port
   at the AC is the well known UDP port [to be IANA assigned].  The
   CAPWAP data port at the WTP can be any port selected by the WTP.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  UDP-Lite Transport</span>

   When CAPWAP is run over IPv6, UDP-Lite is used as the transport
   protocol, reducing the checksum processing required for each packet
   (compared to UDP and IPv6).  When UDP-Lite is used, the checksum
   field MUST have a coverage of 8 [<a href="#ref-11" title="&quot;The Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite)&quot;">11</a>].

   UDP-Lite uses the same port assignments as UDP.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  AC Discovery</span>

   The AC discovery phase allows the WTP to determine which ACs are
   available, and chose the best AC with which to establish a CAPWAP
   session.  The discovery phase occurs when the WTP enters the optional
   Discovery state.  A WTP does not need to complete the AC Discovery
   phase if it uses a pre-configured AC.  This section details the
   mechanism used by a WTP to dynamically discover candidate ACs.

   A WTP and an AC will frequently not reside in the same IP subnet



<span class="grey">Calhoun, Editor, et al.  Expires December 13, 2007             [Page 34]</span>

   (broadcast domain).  When this occurs, the WTP must be capable of
   discovering the AC, without requiring that multicast services are
   enabled in the network.

   When the WTP attempts to establish communication with an AC, it sends
   the Discovery Request message and receives the Discovery Response
   message from the AC(s).  The WTP MUST send the Discovery Request
   message to either the limited broadcast IP address (255.255.255.255),
   a well known multicast address or to the unicast IP address of the
   AC.  For IPv6 networks, since broadcast does not exist, the use of
   "All ACs multicast address" is used instead.  Upon receipt of the
   Discovery Request message, the AC sends a Discovery Response message
   to the unicast IP address of the WTP, regardless of whether the
   Discovery Request message was sent as a broadcast, multicast or
   unicast message.

   WTP use of a limited IP broadcast, multicast or unicast IP address is
   implementation dependent.

   When a WTP transmits a Discovery Request message to a unicast
   address, the WTP must first obtain the IP address of the AC.  Any
   static configuration of an AC's IP address on the WTP non-volatile
   storage is implementation dependent.  However, additional dynamic
   schemes are possible, for example:

   DHCP:  See [<a href="#ref-13" title="&quot;CAPWAP Access Controller DHCP Option&quot;">13</a>] for more information on the use of DHCP to discover
      AC IP addresses.

   DNS:  The DNS name "CAPWAP-AC-Address" MAY be resolvable to one or
      more AC addresses.

   An AC MAY also communicate alternative ACs to the WTP within the
   Discovery Response message through the AC IPv4 List (see
   <a href="#section-4.6.2">Section 4.6.2</a>) and AC IPv6 List (see <a href="#section-4.6.2">Section 4.6.2</a>).  The addresses
   provided in these two message elements are intended to help the WTP
   discover additional ACs through means other than those listed above.

   The AC Name with Index message element (see <a href="#section-4.6.5">Section 4.6.5</a>), is used
   to communicate a list of preferred ACs to the WTP.  The WTP SHOULD
   attempt to utilize the ACs listed in the order provided by the AC.
   The Name to IP Address mapping is handled via the Discovery message
   exchange, in which the ACs provide their identity in the AC Name (see
   <a href="#section-4.6.4">Section 4.6.4</a>) message element in the Discovery Response message.

   Once the WTP has received Discovery Response messages from the
   candidate ACs, it MAY use other factors to determine the preferred
   AC.  For instance, each binding defines a WTP Radio Information
   message element (see <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>), which the AC includes in Discovery

   Response messages.  The presence of one or more of these message
   elements is used to identify the CAPWAP bindings supported by the AC.
   A WTP MAY connect to an AC based on the supported bindings
   advertised.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.4" href="#section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Fragmentation/Reassembly</span>

   While fragmentation and reassembly services are provided by IP, the
   CAPWAP protocol also provides such services.  Environments where the
   CAPWAP protocol is used involve firewall, NAT and "middle box"
   devices, which tend to drop IP fragments to minimize possible DoS
   attacks.  By providing fragmentation and reassembly at the
   application layer, any fragmentation required due to the tunneling
   component of the CAPWAP protocol becomes transparent to these
   intermediate devices.  Consequently, the CAPWAP protocol can be used
   in any network configuration.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  CAPWAP Packet Formats</span>

   This section contains the CAPWAP protocol packet formats.  A CAPWAP
   protocol packet consists of one or more CAPWAP Transport Layer packet
   headers followed by a CAPWAP message.  The CAPWAP message can be
   either of type Control or Data, where Control packets carry
   signaling, and Data packets carry user payloads.  The CAPWAP frame
   formats for CAPWAP Data packets, and for DTLS encapsulated CAPWAP
   Data and Control packets are defined below.

   The CAPWAP Control protocol includes two messages that are never
   protected by DTLS: the Discovery Request message and the Discovery
   Response message.  These messages need to be in the clear to allow
   the CAPWAP protocol to properly identify and process them.  The
   format of these packets are as follows:

       CAPWAP Control Packet (Discovery Request/Response):
       +-------------------------------------------+
       | IP  | UDP | CAPWAP | Control | Message    |
       | Hdr | Hdr | Header | Header  | Element(s) |
       +-------------------------------------------+

   All other CAPWAP control protocol messages MUST be protected via the
   DTLS protocol, which ensures that the packets are both authenticated
   and encrypted.  These packets include the CAPWAP DTLS Header, which
   is described in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>.  The format of these packets is as
   follows:

    CAPWAP Control Packet (DTLS Security Required):
    +------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | IP  | UDP | CAPWAP   | DTLS | CAPWAP | Control| Message   | DTLS |
    | Hdr | Hdr | DTLS Hdr | Hdr  | Header | Header | Element(s)| Trlr |
    +------------------------------------------------------------------+
                           \---------- authenticated -----------/
                                  \------------- encrypted ------------/

   The CAPWAP protocol allows optional protection of data packets, using
   DTLS.  Use of data packet protection is determined by AC policy.
   When DTLS is utilized, the optional CAPWAP DTLS Header is present,
   which is described in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>.  The format of CAPWAP data packets
   is shown below:

                                     \------- encrypted --------/

   UDP Header:  All CAPWAP packets are encapsulated within either UDP,
      or UDP-Lite when used over IPv6.  <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> defines the specific
      UDP or UDP-Lite usage.

   CAPWAP DTLS Header:  All DTLS encrypted CAPWAP protocol packets are
      prefixed with the CAPWAP DTLS header (see <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>).

   DTLS Header:  The DTLS header provides authentication and encryption
      services to the CAPWAP payload it encapsulates.  This protocol is
      defined in <a href="./rfc4347">RFC 4347</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title="&quot;Datagram Transport Layer Security&quot;">8</a>].

   CAPWAP Header:  All CAPWAP protocol packets use a common header that
      immediately follows the CAPWAP preamble or DTLS header.  The
      CAPWAP Header is defined in <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>.

   Wireless Payload:  A CAPWAP protocol packet that contains a wireless
      payload is a CAPWAP data packet.  The CAPWAP protocol does not
      specify the format of the wireless payload, which is defined by
      the appropriate wireless standard.  Additional information is in
      <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>.

   Control Header:  The CAPWAP protocol includes a signalling component,
      known as the CAPWAP control protocol.  All CAPWAP control packets
      include a Control Header, which is defined in <a href="#section-4.5.1">Section 4.5.1</a>.
      CAPWAP data packets do not contain a Control Header field.

   Message Elements:  A CAPWAP Control packet includes one or more
      message elements, which are found immediately following the
      Control Header.  These message elements are in a Type/Length/value
      style header, defined in <a href="#section-4.6">Section 4.6</a>.

   A CAPWAP implementation MUST be capable of receiving a reassembled
   CAPWAP message of length 4096 bytes.  A CAPWAP implementation MAY
   indicate that it supports a higher maximum message length, by

   message.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  CAPWAP Preamble</span>

   The CAPWAP preamble is common to all CAPWAP transport headers and is
   used to identify the header type that immediately follows.  The
   reason for this header is to avoid needing to perform byte
   comparisons in order to guess whether the frame is DTLS encrypted or
   not.  It also provides an extensibility framework that can be used to
   support additional transport types.  The format of the preamble is as
   follows:

         0
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |Version| Type  |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Version:  A 4 bit field which contains the version of CAPWAP used in
      this packet.  The value for this specification is zero (0).

   Payload Type:  A 4 bit field which specifies the payload type that
      follows the UDP header.  The following values are supported:

      0 -  CAPWAP Header.  The CAPWAP Header (see <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>)
         immediately follows the UDP header.  If the packet is received
         on the CAPWAP data channel, the CAPWAP stack MUST treat the
         packet as a clear text CAPWAP data packet.  If received on the
         CAPWAP control channel, the CAPWAP stack MUST treat the packet
         as a clear text CAPWAP control packet.  If the control packet
         is not a Discovery Request or Discovery Response packet, the
         packet MUST be dropped.

      1 -  CAPWAP DTLS Header.  The CAPWAP DTLS Header, and DTLS packet,
         immediately follows the UDP header (see <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  CAPWAP DTLS Header</span>

   The CAPWAP DTLS Header is used to identify the packet as a DTLS
   encrypted packet.  The first eight bits includes the common CAPWAP
   Preamble.  The remaining 24 bits are padding to ensure 4 byte
   alignment, and MAY be used in a future version of the protocol.  The
   DTLS packet [<a href="#ref-8" title="&quot;Datagram Transport Layer Security&quot;">8</a>] always immediately follows this header.  The format
   of the CAPWAP DTLS Header is as follows:

   CAPWAP Preamble:  The CAPWAP Preamble is defined in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.  The
      CAPWAP Preamble's Payload Type field MUST be set to one (1).

   Reserved:  The 24-bit field is reserved for future use.  All
      implementations complying with this protocol MUST set to zero any
      bits that are reserved in the version of the protocol supported by
      that implementation.  Receivers MUST ignore all bits not defined
      for the version of the protocol they support.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  CAPWAP Header</span>

   All CAPWAP protocol messages are encapsulated using a common header
   format, regardless of the CAPWAP Control or CAPWAP Data transport

   CAPWAP Preamble:  The CAPWAP Preamble is defined in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.  The
      CAPWAP Preamble's Payload Type field MUST be set to zero (0).  If
      the CAPWAP DTLS Header is present, the version number in both
      CAPWAP Preambles MUST match.  The reason for this duplicate field
      is to avoid any possible tampering of the version field in the
      preamble which is not encrypted or authenticated.

   HLEN:  A 5 bit field containing the length of the CAPWAP transport
      header in 4 byte words (Similar to IP header length).  This length
      includes the optional headers.

   RID:  A 5 bit field which contains the Radio ID number for this
      packet.  Given that MAC Addresses are not necessarily unique
      across physical radios in a WTP, the Radio Identifier (RID) field
      is used to indiciate which physical radio the message is
      associated with.

   WBID:  A 5 bit field which is the wireless binding identifier.  The
      identifier will indicate the type of wireless packet type
      associated with the radio.  The following values are defined:

      1 -  IEEE 802.11

      2 -  IEEE 802.16

      3 -  EPCGlobal

   T: The Type 'T' bit indicates the format of the frame being
      transported in the payload.  When this bit is set to one (1), the
      payload has the native frame format indicated by the WBID field.
      When this bit is zero (0) the payload is an IEEE 802.3 frame.

   F: The Fragment 'F' bit indicates whether this packet is a fragment.
      When this bit is one (1), the packet is a fragment and MUST be
      combined with the other corresponding fragments to reassemble the
      complete information exchanged between the WTP and AC.

   L: The Last 'L' bit is valid only if the 'F' bit is set and indicates
      whether the packet contains the last fragment of a fragmented
      exchange between WTP and AC.  When this bit is 1, the packet is
      the last fragment.  When this bit is 0, the packet is not the last
      fragment.

   W: The Wireless 'W' bit is used to specify whether the optional
      Wireless Specific Information field is present in the header.  A
      value of one (1) is used to represent the fact that the optional
      header is present.

   M: The M bit is used to indicate that the Radio MAC Address optional
      header is present.  This is used to communicate the MAC address of
      the receiving radio.

   K: The 'Keep-alive' K bit indicates the packet is a Data Channel Keep
      Alive packet.  This packet is used to map the data channel to the
      control channel for the specified Session ID and to maintain
      freshness of the data channel.  The K bit MUST NOT be set for data
      packets containing user data.

   Flags:  A set of reserved bits for future flags in the CAPWAP header.
      All implementations complying with this protocol MUST set to zero
      any bits that are reserved in the version of the protocol
      supported by that implementation.  Receivers MUST ignore all bits
      not defined for the version of the protocol they support.

   Fragment ID:  A 16 bit field whose value is assigned to each group of
      fragments making up a complete set.  The fragment ID space is
      managed individually for every WTP/AC pair.  The value of Fragment
      ID is incremented with each new set of fragments.  The Fragment ID
      wraps to zero after the maximum value has been used to identify a
      set of fragments.

   Fragment Offset:  A 13 bit field that indicates where in the payload
      this fragment belongs during re-assembly.  This field is valid
      when the 'F' bit is set to 1.  The fragment offset is measured in
      units of 8 octets (64 bits).  The first fragment has offset zero.
      Note the CAPWAP protocol does not allow for overlapping fragments.

   Reserved:  The 3-bit field is reserved for future use.  All
      implementations complying with this protocol MUST set to zero any
      bits that are reserved in the version of the protocol supported by
      that implementation.  Receivers MUST ignore all bits not defined
      for the version of the protocol they support.

   Radio MAC Address:  This optional field contains the MAC address of
      the radio receiving the packet.  This is useful in packets sent
      from the WTP to the AC, when the native wireless frame format is
      converted to 802.3 by the WTP.  This field is only present if the
      'M' bit is set.  The HLEN field assumes 4 byte alignment, and this
      field MUST be padded with zeroes (0x00) if it is not 4 byte
      aligned.

      message.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.4" href="#section-4.4">4.4</a>.  CAPWAP Data Messages</span>

   There are two different types of CAPWAP data packets, CAPWAP Data
   Channel Keep Alive packets and Data Payload packets.  The first is
   used by the WTP to synchronize the control and data channels, and to
   maintain freshness of the data channel.  The second is used to
   transmit user payloads between the AC and WTP.  This section
   describes both types of CAPWAP data packet formats.

   Both CAPWAP data messages are transmitted on the CAPWAP data channel.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.4.1" href="#section-4.4.1">4.4.1</a>.  CAPWAP Data Keepalive</span>

   The CAPWAP Data Channel Keep Alive packet is used to bind the CAPWAP
   control channel with the data channel, and to maintain freshness of
   the data channel, ensuring that the channel is still functioning.
   The CAPWAP Data Channel Keep Alive packet is transmitted by the WTP
   when the DataChannelKeepAlive timer expires.  When the CAPWAP Data
   Channel Keep Alive packet is transmitted, the WTP sets the
   DataChannelDeadInterval timer.

   In the CAPWAP Data Channel Keep Alive packet, all of the fields in
   the CAPWAP header, except the HLEN field and the K bit, are set to
   zero upon transmission.  Upon receiving a CAPWAP Data Channel Keep
   Alive packet, the AC transmits a CAPWAP Data Channel Keep Alive
   packet back to the WTP.  The contents of the transmitted packet are
   identical to the contents of the received packet.

   Upon receiving a CAPWAP Data Channel Keep Alive packet, the WTP
   cancels the DataChannelDeadInterval timer and resets the
   DataChannelKeepAlive timer.  The CAPWAP Data Channel Keep Alive
   packet is retransmitted by the WTP in the same manner as the CAPWAP
   control messages.  If the DataChannelDeadInterval timer expires, the
   WTP tears down the control DTLS session, and the data DTLS session if
   one existed.

   The CAPWAP Data Channel Keep Alive packet contains the following
   payload immediately following the CAPWAP Header (see <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>)

      0                   1                   2                   3

   Message Element Length:   The Length field indicates the number of
      bytes following the CAPWAP Header.

   Message Element[0..N]:   The message element(s) carry the information
      pertinent to each of the CAPWAP Data Keepalive message.  The
      following message elements MUST be present in this CAPWAP message:

         Session ID, see <a href="#section-4.6.35">Section 4.6.35</a>

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.4.2" href="#section-4.4.2">4.4.2</a>.  Data Payload</span>

   A CAPWAP protocol Data Payload packet encapsulates a forwarded
   wireless frame.  The CAPWAP protocol defines two different modes of
   encapsulation; IEEE 802.3 and native wireless.  IEEE 802.3



<span class="grey">Calhoun, Editor, et al.  Expires December 13, 2007             [Page 44]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-45" id="page-45" href="#page-45" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey">Internet-Draft        CAPWAP Protocol Specification            June 2007</span>


   encapsulation requires that the bridging function be performed in the
   WTP.  An IEEE 802.3 encapsulated user payload frame has the following
   format:

       +------------------------------------------------------+
       | IP Header | UDP Header | CAPWAP Header | 802.3 Frame |
       +------------------------------------------------------+

   The CAPWAP protocol also defines the native wireless encapsulation
   mode.  The format of the encapsulated CAPWAP data frame is subject to
   the rules defined by the specific wireless technology binding.  Each
   wireless technology binding MUST contain a section entitled "Payload
   Encapsulation", which defines the format of the wireless payload that
   is encapsulated within CAPWAP Data packets.

   If the encapsulated frame would exceed the transport layer's MTU, the
   sender is responsible for fragmentation of the frame, as specified in
   <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.4.3" href="#section-4.4.3">4.4.3</a>.  Establishment of a DTLS Data Channel</span>

   If the AC and WTP are configured to tunnel the data channel over
   DTLS, the proper DTLS session must be initiated.  To avoid having to
   reauthenticate and reauthorize an AC and WTP, the DTLS data channel
   MUST be initiated using the TLS session resumption feature [<a href="#ref-7" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1&quot;">7</a>].

   When establishing the DTLS-encrypted data channel, the WTP MUST
   provide the identifier returned during the initialization of the
   control channel to the DTLS component so it can perform the
   resumption using the proper session information.

   The AC DTLS implementation MUST NOT accept a session resumption
   request for a DTLS session in which the control channel for the
   session has been torn down.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.5" href="#section-4.5">4.5</a>.  CAPWAP Control Messages</span>

   The CAPWAP Control protocol provides a control channel between the
   WTP and the AC.  Control messages are divided into the following
   message types:

   Discovery:  CAPWAP Discovery messages are used to identify potential
      ACs, their load and capabilities.

   Join:  CAPWAP Join messages are used by a WTP to request service from
      an AC, and for the AC to respond to the WTP.

   Control Channel Management:  CAPWAP control channel management
      messages are used to maintain the control channel.

   WTP Configuration Management:  The WTP Configuration messages are
      used by the AC to deliver a specific configuration to the WTP.
      Messages which retrieve statistics from a WTP are also included in
      WTP Configuration Management.

   Station Session Management:  Station Session Management messages are
      used by the AC to deliver specific station policies to the WTP.

   Device Management Operations:  Device management operations are used
      to request and deliver a firmware image to the WTP.

   Binding Specific CAPWAP Management Messages:  Messages in this
      category are used by the AC and the WTP to exchange protocol-
      specific CAPWAP management messages.  These messages may or may
      not be used to change the link state of a station.

   Discovery, Join, Control Channel Management, WTP Configuration
   Management and Station Session Management CAPWAP control messages
   MUST be implemented.  Device Management Operations messages MAY be
   implemented.

   CAPWAP control messages sent from the WTP to the AC indicate that the
   WTP is operational, providing an implicit keep-alive mechanism for
   the WTP.  The Control Channel Management Echo Request and Echo
   Response messages provide an explicit keep-alive mechanism when other
   CAPWAP control messages are not exchanged.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.5.1" href="#section-4.5.1">4.5.1</a>.  Control Message Format</span>

   All CAPWAP control messages are sent encapsulated within the CAPWAP
   header (see <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>).  Immediately following the CAPWAP header,
   is the control header, which has the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.5.1.1" href="#section-4.5.1.1">4.5.1.1</a>.  Message Type</span>

   The Message Type field identifies the function of the CAPWAP control
   message.  The Message Type field is comprised of an IANA Enterprise
   Number and an enterprise specific message type number.  The first
   three octets contain the enterprise number in network byte order,
   with zero used for CAPWAP protocol defined message types and the IEEE
   802.11 IANA assigned enterprise number 13277 is used for IEEE 802.11
   technology specific message types.  The last octet is the enterprise
   specific message type number, which has a range from 0 to 255.

   The message type field is defined as:

         Message Type =
                 IANA Enterprise Number * 256 +
                     Enterprise Specific Message Type Number

   The CAPWAP protocol reliability mechanism requires that messages be
   defined in pairs, consisting of both a Request and a Response
   message.  The Response message MUST acknowledge the Request message.
   The assignment of CAPWAP control Message Type Values always occurs in
   pairs.  All Request messages have odd numbered Message Type Values,
   and all Response messages have even numbered Message Type Values.
   The Request value MUST be assigned first.  As an example, assigning a
   Message Type Value of 3 for a Request message and 4 for a Response
   message is valid, while assigning a Message Type Value of 4 for a
   Response message and 5 for the corresponding Request message is
   invalid.

   When a WTP or AC receives a message with a Message Type Value field
   that is not recognized and is an odd number, the number in the
   Message Type Value Field is incremented by one, and a Response
   message with a Message Type Value field containing the incremented
   value and containing the Result Code message element with the value
   (Unrecognized Request) is returned to the sender of the received
   message.  If the unknown message type is even, the message is
   ignored.

   The valid values for CAPWAP Control Message Types are specified in
   the table below:

   Message Type Value is received, the value of the Sequence Number
   field is copied into the corresponding Response message.

   When a CAPWAP control message is sent, the sender's internal sequence
   number counter is monotonically incremented, ensuring that no two
   pending Request messages have the same Sequence Number.  The Sequence
   Number field wraps back to zero.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.5.1.3" href="#section-4.5.1.3">4.5.1.3</a>.  Message Element Length</span>

   The Length field indicates the number of bytes following the Sequence
   Number field.

   The message element(s) carry the information pertinent to each of the
   control message types.  Every control message in this specification
   specifies which message elements are permitted.

   When a WTP or AC receives a CAPWAP message without a message element
   that is specified as mandatory for the CAPWAP message, then the
   CAPWAP message is discarded.  If the received message was a Request
   message for which the corresponding Response message carries message
   elements, then a corresponding Response message with a Result Code
   message element indicating "Failure - Missing Mandatory Message
   Element" is returned to the sender.

   When a WTP or AC receives a CAPWAP message with a message element
   that the WTP or AC does not recognize, the CAPWAP message is
   discarded.  If the received message was a Request message for which
   the corresponding Response message carries message elements, then a
   corresponding Response message with a Result Code message element
   indicating "Failure - Unrecognized Message Element" and one or more
   Returned Message Element message elements is included, containing the
   unrecognized message element(s).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.5.2" href="#section-4.5.2">4.5.2</a>.  Control Message Quality of Service</span>

   It is recommended that CAPWAP control messages be sent by both the AC
   and the WTP with an appropriate Quality of Service precedence value,
   ensuring that congestion in the network minimizes occurrences of
   CAPWAP control channel disconnects.  Therefore, a Quality of Service
   enabled CAPWAP device SHOULD use the following values:

   802.1P:   The precedence value of 7 SHOULD be used.

   DSCP:   The DSCP tag value of 46 SHOULD be used.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.5.3" href="#section-4.5.3">4.5.3</a>.  Retransmissions</span>

   The CAPWAP control protocol operates as a reliable transport.  For
   each Request message, a Response message is defined, which is used to
   acknowledge receipt of the Request message.  In addition, the control
   header Sequence Number field is used to pair the Request and Response
   messages (see <a href="#section-4.5.1">Section 4.5.1</a>).

   Response messages are not explicitly acknowledged, therefore if a

   Response message is not received, the original Request message is
   retransmitted.  Implementations MAY cache Response messages to
   respond to a retransmitted Request messages with minimal local
   processing.  Retransmitted Request messages MUST NOT be altered by
   the sender.  The sender MUST assume that the original Request message
   was processed, but that the Response message was lost.  Any
   alterations to the original Request message MUST have a new Sequence
   Number, and be treated as a new Request message by the receiver.

   After transmitting a Request message, the RetransmitInterval (see
   <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>) timer and MaxRetransmit (see <a href="#section-4.8">Section 4.8</a>) variable are
   used to determine if the original Request message needs to be
   retransmitted.  The RetransmitInterval timer is used the first time
   the Request is retransmitted.  The timer is then doubled every
   subsequent time the same Request message is retransmitted, up to
   MaxRetransmit but no more than half the EchoInterval timer (see
   <a href="#section-4.7.5">Section 4.7.5</a>).  Response messages are not subject to these timers.

   When a Request message is retransmitted, it MUST be re-encrypted via
   the DTLS stack.  If the peer had received the Request message, and
   the corresponding Response message was lost, it is necessary to
   ensure that retransmitted Request messages are not identified as
   replays by the DTLS stack.  Similarly, any cached Response messages
   that are retransmitted as a result of receiving a retransmitted
   Request message MUST be re-encrypted via DTLS.

   Duplicate Response messages, identified by the Sequence Number field
   in the CAPWAP control message header, SHOULD be discarded upon
   receipt.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.6" href="#section-4.6">4.6</a>.  CAPWAP Protocol Message Elements</span>

   This section defines the CAPWAP Protocol message elements which are
   included in CAPWAP protocol control messages.

   Message elements are used to carry information needed in control
   messages.  Every message element is identified by the Type Value
   field, defined below.  The total length of the message elements is
   indicated in the message element Length field.

   All of the message element definitions in this document use a diagram
   similar to the one below in order to depict its format.  Note that to
   simplify this specification, these diagrams do not include the header
   fields (Type and Length).  The header field values are defined in the
   message element descriptions.

   Unless otherwise specified, a control message that lists a set of
   supported (or expected) message elements MUST not expect the message

   elements to be in any specific order.  The sender MAY include the
   message elements in any order.  Unless otherwise noted, one message
   element of each type is present in a given control message.

   Additional message elements may be defined in separate IETF
   documents.

   The format of a message element uses the TLV format shown here:

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  CAPWAP Discovery Operations</span>

   The Discovery messages are used by a WTP to determine which ACs are
   available to provide service, and the capabilities and load of the
   ACs.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Discovery Request Message</span>

   The Discovery Request message is used by the WTP to automatically
   discover potential ACs available in the network.  The Discovery
   Request message provides ACs with the primary capabilities of the
   WTP.  A WTP must exchange this information to ensure subsequent
   exchanges with the ACs are consistent with the WTP's functional
   characteristics.

   Discovery Request messages MUST be sent by a WTP in the Discover
   state after waiting for a random delay less than
   MaxDiscoveryInterval, after a WTP first comes up or is
   (re)initialized.  A WTP MUST send no more than the maximum of
   MaxDiscoveries Discovery Request messages, waiting for a random delay
   less than MaxDiscoveryInterval between each successive message.

   This is to prevent an explosion of WTP Discovery Request messages.
   An example of this occurring is when many WTPs are powered on at the
   same time.

   Discovery Request messages MUST be sent by a WTP when no Echo
   Response messages are received for NeighborDeadInterval and the WTP
   returns to the Idle state.  Discovery Request messages are sent after
   NeighborDeadInterval.  They MUST be sent after waiting for a random
   delay less than MaxDiscoveryInterval.  A WTP MAY send up to a maximum
   of MaxDiscoveries Discovery Request messages, waiting for a random
   delay less than MaxDiscoveryInterval between each successive message.

   If a Discovery Response message is not received after sending the
   maximum number of Discovery Request messages, the WTP enters the
   Sulking state and MUST wait for an interval equal to SilentInterval
   before sending further Discovery Request messages.

   Upon receiving a Discovery Request message, the AC will respond with
   a Discovery Response message sent to the address in the source
   address of the received Discovery Request message.

   It is possible for the AC to receive a cleartext Discovery Request
   message while a DTLS session is already active with the WTP.  This is
   most likely the case if the WTP has rebooted, perhaps due to a
   software or power failure, but could also be caused by a DoS attack.
   In such cases, any WTP state, including the state machine instance,

   MUST NOT be cleared until another DTLS session has been successfully
   established, communicated via the DTLSSessionEstablished DTLS
   notification (see <a href="#section-2.3.2.2">Section 2.3.2.2</a>).

   The binding specific WTP Radio Information message element (see
   <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>) is included in the Discovery Request message to
   advertise WTP support for one or more CAPWAP bindings.

   The Discovery Request message is sent by the WTP when in the
   Discovery State.  The AC does not transmit this message.

   The following message elements MUST be included in the Discovery
   Request message:

   o  Discovery Type, see <a href="#section-4.6.20">Section 4.6.20</a>

   o  WTP Board Data, see <a href="#section-4.6.38">Section 4.6.38</a>

   o  WTP MAC Type, see <a href="#section-4.6.44">Section 4.6.44</a>

   o  WTP Radio Information message element(s)that the WTP supports;
      These are defined by the individual link layer CAPWAP Binding
      Protocols (see <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Discovery Response Message</span>

   The Discovery Response message provides a mechanism for an AC to
   advertise its services to requesting WTPs.

   When a WTP receives a Discovery Response message, it MUST wait for an
   interval not less than DiscoveryInterval for receipt of additional
   Discovery Response messages.  After the DiscoveryInterval elapses,
   the WTP enters the DTLS-Init state and selects one of the ACs that
   sent a Discovery Response message and send a DTLS Handshake to that
   AC.

   One or more binding specific WTP Radio Information message elements
   (see <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>) are included in the Discovery Request message to
   advertise AC support for the CAPWAP bindings.  The AC MAY include
   only the bindings it shares in common with the WTP, known through the
   WTP Radio Information message elements received in the Discovery
   Request message, or it MAY include all of the bindings supported.
   The WTP MAY use the supported bindings in its AC decision process.
   Note that if the WTP joins an AC that does not support a specific

      These are defined by the individual link layer CAPWAP Binding
      Protocols (see <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a> for more information).

   o  One of the following message elements MUST be included in the
      Discovery Response Message:

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.3" href="#section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Primary Discovery Request Message</span>

   The Primary Discovery Request message is sent by the WTP to determine
   whether its preferred (or primary) AC is available.

   A Primary Discovery Request message is sent by a WTP when it has a
   primary AC configured, and is connected to another AC.  This
   generally occurs as a result of a failover, and is used by the WTP as
   a means to discover when its primary AC becomes available.  Since the
   WTP only has a single instance of the CAPWAP state machine, the
   Primary Discovery Request is sent by the WTP when in the Run State.
   The AC does not transmit this message.

   The frequency of the Primary Discovery Request messages should be no
   more often than the sending of the Echo Request message.

   Upon receipt of a Primary Discovery Request message, the AC responds
   with a Primary Discovery Response message sent to the address in the
   source address of the received Primary Discovery Request message.

   The following message elements MUST be included in the Primary
   Discovery Request message.

   The Primary Discovery Response message enables an AC to advertise its
   availability and services to requesting WTPs that are configured to
   have the AC as its primary AC.

   The Primary Discovery Response message is sent by an AC after
   receiving a Primary Discovery Request message.

   When a WTP receives a Primary Discovery Response message, it may
   establish a CAPWAP protocol connection to its primary AC, based on
   the configuration of the WTP Fallback Status message element on the
   WTP.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  CAPWAP Join Operations</span>

   The Join Request message is used by a WTP to request service from an
   AC after a DTLS connection is established to that AC.  The Join
   Response message is used by the the AC to indicate that it will or
   will not provide service.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-6.1" href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Join Request</span>

   The Join Request message is used by a WTP to request service through
   the AC.  A Join Request message is sent by a WTP after (optionally)
   receiving one or more Discovery Response messages, and completion of
   DTLS session establishment.  When an AC receives a Join Request
   message it responds with a Join Response message.

   Upon completion of the DTLS handshake, and receiving the
   DTLSEstablished notification, the WTP sends the Join Request message
   to the AC.  When the AC is notified of the DTLS session
   establishment, it does not clear the WaitDTLS timer until it has
   received the Join Request message, at which time it sends a Join
   Response message to the WTP, indicating success or failure.

   One or more WTP Radio Information message elements (see <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>)
   are included in the Join Request to request service for the CAPWAP
   bindings by the AC.  Including a binding that is unsupported by the
   AC will result in a failed Join Response.

   If the AC rejects the Join Request, it sends a Join Response message
   with a failure indication and initiates an abort of the DTLS session
   via the DTLSAbort command.

   If an invalid (i.e. malformed) Join Request message is received, the
   message MUST be silently discarded by the AC.  No response is sent to
   the WTP.  The AC SHOULD log this event.

   The Join Request is sent by the WTP when in the Join State.  The AC
   does not transmit this message.

   The following message elements MUST be included in the Join Request
   message.

   o  Location Data, see <a href="#section-4.6.28">Section 4.6.28</a>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-6.2" href="#section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Join Response</span>

   The Join Response message is sent by the AC to indicate to a WTP that
   it is capable and willing to provide service to the WTP.

   The WTP, receiving a Join Response message, checks for success or
   failure.  If the message indicates success, the WTP clears the
   WaitDTLS timer for the session and proceeds to the Configure state.

   If the WaitDTLS Timer expires prior to reception of the Join Response
   message, the WTP MUST terminate the handshake, deallocate session
   state and initiate the DTLSAbort command.

   If an invalid (malformed) Join Response message is received, the WTP
   SHOULD log an informative message detailing the error.  This error
   MUST be treated in the same manner as AC non-responsiveness.  The
   WaitDTLS timer will eventually expire, and the WTP MAY (if it is so
   configured) attempts to join a new AC.

   The AC includes the Image Identifier message element to indicate the
   software version it expects the WTP to run.  This information is used
   to determine whether the WTP MUST either change its currently running
   firmware image, or download a new version (see <a href="#section-9.1.1">Section 9.1.1</a>).

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Control Channel Management</span>

   The Control Channel Management messages are used by the WTP and AC to
   maintain a control communication channel.  CAPWAP control messages,
   such as the WTP Event Request message sent from the WTP to the AC
   indicate to the AC that the WTP is operational.  When such control
   messages are not being sent, the Echo Request and Echo Response
   messages are used to maintain the control communication channel.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.1" href="#section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Echo Request</span>

   The Echo Request message is a keep-alive mechanism for CAPWAP control
   messages.

   Echo Request messages are sent periodically by a WTP in the Run state
   (see <a href="#section-2.3">Section 2.3</a>) to determine the state of the control connection
   between the WTP and the AC.  The Echo Request message is sent by the
   WTP when the EchoInterval timer expires.  The WTP MUST start its
   NeighborDeadInterval timer when the EchoInterval timer expires.

   The Echo Request message is sent by the WTP when in the Run State.
   The AC does not transmit this message.

   The Echo Request message carries no message elements.

   When an AC receives an Echo Request message it responds with an Echo
   Response message.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.2" href="#section-7.2">7.2</a>.  Echo Response</span>

   The Echo Response message acknowledges the Echo Request message.

   An Echo Response message is sent by an AC after receiving an
   EchoRequest message.  After transmitting the Echo Response message,
   the AC SHOULD reset its EchoInterval timer.  If another Echo Request
   message or other control message is not received by the AC when the
   timer expires, the AC SHOULD consider the WTP to be no longer
   reachable.

   The Echo Response message is sent by the AC when in the Run State.
   The WTP does not transmit this message.

   The Echo Response message carries no message elements.

   When a WTP receives an Echo Response message it stops the

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>.  WTP Configuration Management</span>

   WTP Configuration messages are used to exchange configuration
   information between the AC and the WTP.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.1" href="#section-8.1">8.1</a>.  Configuration Consistency</span>

   The CAPWAP protocol provides flexibility in how WTP configuration is
   managed.  A WTP has two options:

   1. The WTP retains no configuration and accepts the configuration
      provided by the AC.

   2. The WTP retains the configuration of parameters provided by the AC
      that are non-default values.

   If the WTP opts to save configuration locally, the CAPWAP protocol
   state machine defines the Configure state, which allows for
   configuration exchange.  In the Configure state, the WTP sends its
   current configuration overrides to the AC via the Configuration
   Status message.  A configuration override is a non-default parameter.
   As an example, in the CAPWAP protocol, the default antenna
   configuration is internal omni antenna.  A WTP that either has no
   internal antennas, or has been explicitly configured by the AC to use
   external antennas, sends its antenna configuration during the
   configure phase, allowing the AC to become aware of the WTP's current
   configuration.

   Once the WTP has provided its configuration to the AC, the AC sends
   its configuration to the WTP.  This allows the WTP to receive
   configuration and policies from the AC.

   The AC maintains a copy of each active WTP configuration.  There is
   no need for versioning or other means to identify configuration
   changes.  If a WTP becomes inactive, the AC MAY delete the inactive
   WTP configuration.  If a WTP fails, and connects to a new AC, the WTP
   provides its overridden configuration parameters, allowing the new AC
   to be aware of the WTP configuration.

   This model allows for resiliency in case of an AC failure, ensuring
   another AC can provide service to the WTP.  A new AC would be
   automatically updated with WTP configuration changes, eliminating the
   need for inter-AC communication and the need for all ACs to be aware
   of the configuration of all WTPs in the network.

   Once the CAPWAP protocol enters the Run state, the WTPs begin to
   provide service.  It is common for administrators to require that
   configuration changes be made while the network is operational.

   Therefore, the Configuration Update Request is sent by the AC to the
   WTP to make these changes at run-time.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.1.1" href="#section-8.1.1">8.1.1</a>.  Configuration Flexibility</span>

   The CAPWAP protocol provides the flexibility to configure and manage
   WTPs of varying design and functional characteristics.  When a WTP
   first discovers an AC, it provides primary functional information
   relating to its type of MAC and to the nature of frames to be
   exchanged.  The AC configures the WTP appropriately.  The AC also
   establishes corresponding internal state for the WTP.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.2" href="#section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Configuration Status</span>

   The Configuration Status message is sent by a WTP to deliver its
   current configuration to the AC.

   The Configuration Status message carries binding specific message
   elements.  Refer to the appropriate binding for the definition of
   this structure.

   When an AC receives a Configuration Status message it acts upon the
   content of the message and responds to the WTP with a Configuration
   Status Response message.

   The Configuration Status message includes multiple Radio
   Administrative State message elements, one for the WTP, and one for
   each radio in the WTP.

   The Configuration Status message is sent by the WTP when in the
   Configure State.  The AC does not transmit this message.

   The following message elements MUST be included in the Configuration
   Status message.

   o  AC Name, see <a href="#section-4.6.4">Section 4.6.4</a>

   o  AC Name with Index, see <a href="#section-4.6.5">Section 4.6.5</a>

   o  WTP Reboot Statistics, see <a href="#section-4.6.48">Section 4.6.48</a>

   The following message elements MAY be included in the Configuration
   Status message.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.3" href="#section-8.3">8.3</a>.  Configuration Status Response</span>

   The Configuration Status Response message is sent by an AC and
   provides a mechanism for the AC to override a WTP's requested
   configuration.

   A Configuration Status Response message is sent by an AC after
   receiving a Configuration Request message.

   The Configuration Status Response message carries binding specific
   message elements.  Refer to the appropriate binding for the
   definition of this structure.

   When a WTP receives a Configuration Status Response message it acts
   upon the content of the message, as appropriate.  If the
   Configuration Status Response message includes a Radio Operational
   State message element that causes a change in the operational state
   of one of the radios, the WTP transmits a Change State Event to the
   AC, as an acknowledgement of the change in state.

   The Configuration Status Response message is sent by the AC when in
   the Configure State.  The WTP does not transmit this message.

   The following message elements MUST be included in the Configuration
   Status Response message.

   o  AC IPv4 List, see <a href="#section-4.6.2">Section 4.6.2</a>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.4" href="#section-8.4">8.4</a>.  Configuration Update Request</span>

   Configuration Update Request messages are sent by the AC to provision
   the WTP while in the Run state.  This is used to modify the
   configuration of the WTP while it is operational.

   When a WTP receives a Configuration Update Request message, it
   responds with a Configuration Update Response message, with a Result
   Code message element indicating the result of the configuration
   request.

   The AC includes the Image Identifier and Initiate Download message
   elements to force the WTP to update its firmware while in the Run
   state.  The WTP MAY proceed to download the requested firmware if it
   determines the version specified in the Image Identifier message
   element is not in its non-volatile storage (see <a href="#section-9.1.1">Section 9.1.1</a>).

   The Configuration Update Request is sent by the AC when in the Run
   State.  The WTP does not transmit this message.

   One or more of the following message elements MAY be included in the
   Configuration Update message.

   The Configuration Update Response message is the acknowledgement
   message for the Configuration Update Request message.

   The Configuration Update Response message is sent by a WTP after
   receiving a Configuration Update Request message.

   When an AC receives a Configuration Update Response message the
   result code indicates if the WTP successfully accepted the
   configuration.

   The Configuration Update Response message is sent by the WTP when in
   the Run State.  The AC does not transmit this message.

   The following message element MUST be present in the Configuration
   Update message.

   Result Code, see <a href="#section-4.6.33">Section 4.6.33</a>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.6" href="#section-8.6">8.6</a>.  Change State Event Request</span>

   The Change State Event Request message is used by the WTP for two
   main purposes:

   o  When sent by the WTP following the reception of a Configuration
      Status Response message from the AC, the WTP uses the Change State
      Event Request message to provide an update on the WTP radio's
      operational state and to confirm that the configuration provided
      by the AC was successfully applied.

   o  When sent during the Run state, the WTP uses the Change State
      Event Request message to notify the AC of an unexpected change in

      the WTP's radio operational state.

   When an AC receives a Change State Event Request message it responds
   with a Change State Event Response message and modifies its data
   structures for the WTP as needed.  The AC MAY decide not to provide
   service to the WTP if it receives an error, based on local policy,
   and to transition to the Reset state.

   The Change State Event Request message is sent by a WTP to
   acknowledge or report an error condition to the AC for a requested
   configuration in the Configuration Status Response message.  The
   Change State Event Request message includes the Result Code message
   element, which indicates whether the configuration was successfully
   applied.  If the WTP is unable to apply a specfic configuration
   request, it indicates the failure by including one or more Returned
   Message Element message elements (see <a href="#section-4.6.34">Section 4.6.34</a>).

   The Change State Event Request message is sent by the WTP in the
   Configure or Run State.  The AC does not transmit this message.

   The WTP MAY save its configuration to persistent storage prior to
   transmitting the response.  However, this is implementation specific
   and is not required.

   The following message elements MUST be present in the Change State
   Event Request message.

   o  Radio Operational State, see <a href="#section-4.6.32">Section 4.6.32</a>

   o  Result Code, see <a href="#section-4.6.33">Section 4.6.33</a>

   A Change State Event Response message is sent by an AC in response to
   a Change State Event Request message.

   The Change State Event Response message is sent by the AC when in the
   Configure or Run state.  The WTP does not transmit this message.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-9.1.1" href="#section-9.1.1">9.1.1</a>.  Image Data Request</span>

   The Image Data Request message is used to update firmware on the WTP.
   This message and its companion Response message are used by the AC to
   ensure that the image being run on each WTP is appropriate.

   Image Data Request messages are exchanged between the WTP and the AC
   to download a new firmware image to the WTP.  When a WTP or AC
   receives an Image Data Request message it responds with an Image Data
   Response message.  The message elements contained within the Image
   Data Request message are required to determine the intent of the
   request.

   The decision that new firmware is to be downloaded to the WTP can
   occur in one of two ways:

      When the WTP joins the AC, the Join Response message includes the
      Image Identifier message element, which informs the WTP of the
      firmware it is expected to run. if the WTP does not currently have
      the requested firmware version, it transmits an Image Data Request
      message, with the appropriate Image Identifier message element.
      If the WTP already has the requested firmware, it simply resets.

      Once the WTP is in the Run state, it is possible for the AC to
      cause the WTP to initiate a firmware download by sending a
      Configuration Update Request message with the Initiate Download
      and and Image Identifier message elements.  The WTP then transmits



<span class="grey">Calhoun, Editor, et al.  Expires December 13, 2007            [Page 112]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-113" id="page-113" href="#page-113" class="invisible"> </a>

      the Image Data Request message, which includes the Image
      Identifier message element to start the download process.  Note
      that when the firmware is downloaded in this way, the WTP does not
      automatically reset after the download is complete.  The WTP will
      only reset when it receives a Reset Request message from the AC.
      If the WTP already had the requested firmware version in its non-
      volatile storage, the WTP does not transmit the Image Data Request
      message and responds with a Configuration Update Response message
      with the Result Code set to Image Already Present.

   Regardless of how the download was initiated, once the AC receives an
   Image Data Request message with the Image Identifier message element,
   it begins the transfer process by transmitting an Image Data Request
   message that includes the Image Data message element.  This continues
   until the firmware image has been transfered.

   The Image Data Request message is sent by the WTP or the AC when in
   the Image Data or Run State.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-11" href="#section-11">11</a>.  NAT Considerations</span>

   There are three specific situations in which a NAT deployment may be
   used in conjunction with a CAPWAP-enabled deployment.  The first
   consists of a configuration in which a single WTP is behind a NAT
   system.  Since all communication is initiated by the WTP, and all
   communication is performed over IP using two UDP ports, the protocol
   easily traverses NAT systems in this configuration.

   In the second case, two or more WTPs are deployed behind the same NAT
   system.  Here, the AC would receive multiple connection requests from
   the same IP address, and cannot differentiate the originating WTP of
   the connection requests.  The CAPWAP Data Check state, which
   establishes the data plane connection and communicates the Data
   Keepalive, includes the Session Identifier message element, which is
   used to bind the control and data plane.  Use of the Session
   Identifier message element enables the AC to match the control and
   data plane flows from multiple WTPs behind the same NAT system
   (multiple WTPs sharing the same IP address).

   In the third configuration, the AC is deployed behind a NAT.  Two
   issues exist in this situation.  First, an AC communicates its
   interfaces and corresponding WTP load using the CAPWAP Control
   IP(v4/v6) Address message element.  This message element is currently
   mandatory, and if NAT compliance becomes an issue, it is possible to
   either:

   1. Make the CAPWAP Control IP (v4/v6) Address optional, allowing the
      WTP to use the known IP Address.  Note that this approach
      eliminates the ability to perform load balancing of WTP across
      ACs, and therefore is not the recommended approach.

   2. Allow an AC to configure a NAT'ed address for every AC that would
      otherwise be communicated in the CAPWAP Control IP (v4/v6) Address
      message element.

   3. Require that if a WTP determines that the AC List message element
      contains a set of IP Addresses that are different from the AC IP
      Address the WTP is currently using, then assume that NAT is
      present, and require that the WTP communicate with the AC IP
      Address (and ignore the CAPWAP Control IP (v4/v6) Address message
      element(s)).

   The CAPWAP protocol allows for all of the AC identities supporting a
   group of WTPs to be communicated through the AC List message element.
   This feature MUST be disabled when the AC is behind a NAT and the IP
   Address that is embedded is invalid.

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft        CAPWAP Protocol Specification            June 2007</span>


   The CAPWAP protocol allows an AC to configure a static IP address on
   a WTP using the WTP Static IP Address Information message element.
   This message element SHOULD NOT be used in NAT'ed environments,
   unless the administrator is familiar with the internal IP addressing
   scheme within the WTP's private network, and does not rely on the
   public address seen by the AC.

   When a WTP detects the duplicate address condition, it generates a
   message to the AC, which includes the Duplicate IP Address message
   element.  The IP Address embedded within this message element is
   different from the public IP address seen by the AC.

   When CAPWAP is run over IPv6, NAT support can only be provided if the
   IPv6 NAT system is capable of performing address translation over the
   UDP-Lite 3828 protocol [<a href="#ref-11" title="&quot;The Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite)&quot;">11</a>].  A protocol interoperability issues will
   exist if the NAT system is being utilized for IPv4/IPv6 address
   translation.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-12" href="#section-12">12</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This section describes security considerations for the CAPWAP
   protocol.  It also provides security recommendations for protocols
   used in conjunction with CAPWAP.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-12.1" href="#section-12.1">12.1</a>.  CAPWAP Security</span>

   As it is currently specified, the CAPWAP protocol sits between the
   security mechanisms specified by the wireless link layer protocol
   (e.g.IEEE 802.11i) and AAA.  One goal of CAPWAP is to bootstrap trust
   between the STA and WTP using a series of preestablished trust
   relationships:


         STA            WTP           AC            AAA
         ==============================================

                            DTLS Cred     AAA Cred
                         &lt;------------&gt;&lt;-------------&gt;

                         EAP Credential
          &lt;------------------------------------------&gt;

           wireless link layer
           (e.g.802.11 PTK)
          &lt;--------------&gt; or
          &lt;---------------------------&gt;
              (derived)

   Within CAPWAP, DTLS is used to secure the link between the WTP and
   AC.  In addition to securing control messages, it's also a link in
   this chain of trust for establishing link layer keys.  Consequently,
   much rests on the security of DTLS.

   In some CAPWAP deployment scenarios, there are two channels between
   the WTP and AC: the control channel, carrying CAPWAP control
   messages, and the data channel, over which client data packets are
   tunneled between the AC and WTP.  Typically, the control channel is
   secured by DTLS, while the data channel is not.

   The use of parallel protected and unprotected channels deserves
   special consideration, but does not create a threat.  There are two
   potential concerns: attempting to convert protected data into un-
   protected data and attempting to convert un-protected data into
   protected data.  These concerns are addressed below.

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft        CAPWAP Protocol Specification            June 2007</span>


<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-12.1.1" href="#section-12.1.1">12.1.1</a>.  Converting Protected Data into Unprotected Data</span>

   Since CAPWAP does not support authentication-only ciphers (i.e. all
   supported ciphersuites include encryption and authentication), it is
   not possible to convert protected data into unprotected data.  Since
   encrypted data is (ideally) indistinguishable from random data, the
   probability of an encrypted packet passing for a well-formed packet
   is effectively zero.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-12.1.2" href="#section-12.1.2">12.1.2</a>.  Converting Unprotected Data into Protected Data (Insertion)</span>

   The use of message authentication makes it impossible for the
   attacker to forge protected records.  This makes conversion of
   unprotected records to protected records impossible.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-12.1.3" href="#section-12.1.3">12.1.3</a>.  Deletion of Protected Records</span>

   An attacker could remove protected records from the stream, though
   not undetectably so, due the built-in reliability of the underlying
   CAPWAP protocol.  In the worst case, the attacker would remove the
   same record repeatedly, resulting in a CAPWAP session timeout and
   restart.  This is effectively a DoS attack, and could be accomplished
   by a man in the middle regardless of the CAPWAP protocol security
   mechanisms chosen.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-12.1.4" href="#section-12.1.4">12.1.4</a>.   Insertion of Unprotected Records</span>

   An attacker could inject packets into the unprotected channel, but
   this may become evident if sequence number desynchronization occurs
   as a result.  Only if the attacker is a MiM can packets be inserted
   undetectably.  This is a consequence of that channel's lack of
   protection, and not a new threat resulting from the CAPWAP security
   mechanism.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-12.2" href="#section-12.2">12.2</a>.  Session ID Security</span>

   Since DTLS does not export a unique session identifier, there can be
   no explicit protocol binding between the DTLS layer and CAPWAP layer.
   As a result, implementations MUST provide a mechanism for performing
   this binding.  For example, an AC MUST NOT associate decrypted DTLS
   control packets with a particular WTP session based solely on the
   Session ID in the packet header.  Instead, identification should be
   done based on which DTLS session decrypted the packet.  Otherwise one
   authenticated WTP could spoof another authenticated WTP by altering
   the Session ID in the encrypted CAPWAP header.

   It should be noted that when the CAPWAP data channel is unencrypted,
   the WTP Session ID is exposed and possibly known to adversaries and



<span class="grey">Calhoun, Editor, et al.  Expires December 13, 2007            [Page 122]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-123" id="page-123" href="#page-123" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey">Internet-Draft        CAPWAP Protocol Specification            June 2007</span>


   other WTPs.  This would allow the forgery of the source of data-
   channel traffic.  This, however, should not be a surprise for
   unencrypted data channels.  When the data channel is encrypted, the
   Session ID is not exposed, and therefore can safely be used to
   associate a data and control channel.  The 64-bit length of the
   Session ID mitigates online guessing attacks where an adversarial,
   authenticated WTP tries to correlate his own data channel with
   another WTP's control channel.  Note that for encrypted data
   channels, the Session ID should only be used for correlation for the
   first packet immediately after the initial DTLS handshake.  Future
   correlation should instead be done via identification of a packet's
   DTLS session.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-12.3" href="#section-12.3">12.3</a>.  Discovery Attacks</span>

   Since the Discovery Request messages are sent in the clear, it is
   important that AC implementations NOT assume that receiving such a
   request from a WTP implies that it has rebooted, and consequently
   tear down any active DTLS sessions.  Discovery Request messages can
   easily be spoofed by malicious devices, so it is important that the
   AC maintain two separate sets of states for the WTP until the
   DTLSSessionEstablished notification is received, indicating that the
   WTP was authenticated.  Once a new DTLS session is successfully
   established, any state referring to the old session can be cleared.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-12.4" href="#section-12.4">12.4</a>.  Interference with a DTLS Session</span>

   If a WTP or AC repeatedly receives packets which fail DTLS
   authentication or decryption, this could indicate a DTLS
   desynchronization between the AC and WTP, a link prone to
   undetectable bit errors, or an attacker trying to disrupt a DTLS
   session.

   In the state machine (<a href="#section-2.3">section 2.3</a>), transitions to the DTLS tear down
   state can be triggered by frequently receiving DTLS packets with
   authentication or decryption errors.  The threshold or technique for
   deciding when to move to the tear down state should be chosen
   carefully.  Being able to easily transition to DTLS TD allows easy
   detection of malfunctioning devices, but allows for denial of service
   attacks.  Making it difficult to transition to DTLS TD prevents
   denial of service attacks, but makes it more difficult to detect and
   reset a malfunctioning session.  Implementers should set this policy
   with care.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-12.5" href="#section-12.5">12.5</a>.  Use of Preshared Keys in CAPWAP</span>

   While use of preshared keys may provide deployment and provisioning
   advantages not found in public key based deployments, it also

   introduces a number of operational and security concerns.  In
   particular, because the keys must typically be entered manually, it
   is common for people to base them on memorable words or phrases.
   These are referred to as "low entropy passwords/passphrases".

   Use of low-entropy preshared keys, coupled with the fact that the
   keys are often not frequently updated, tends to significantly
   increase exposure.  For these reasons, the following recommendations
   are made:

   o  When DTLS is used with a preshared-key (PSK) ciphersuite, each WTP
      SHOULD have a unique PSK.  Since WTPs will likely be widely
      deployed, their physical security is not guaranteed.  If PSKs are
      not unique for each WTP, key reuse would allow the compromise of
      one WTP to result in the compromise of others

   o  Generating PSKs from low entropy passwords is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   o  It is RECOMMENDED that implementations that allow the
      administrator to manually configure the PSK also provide a
      capability for generation of new random PSKs, taking <a href="./rfc4086">RFC 4086</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;Randomness Requirements for Security&quot;">2</a>]
      into account.

   o  Preshared keys SHOULD be periodically updated.  Implementations
      MAY facilitate this by providing an administrative interface for
      automatic key generation and periodic update, or it MAY be
      accomplished manually instead.

   Every pairwise combination of WTP and AC on the network SHOULD have a
   unqiue PSK.  This prevents the domino effect (see Guidance for AAA
   Key Management [<a href="#ref-16" title="&quot;Guidance for AAA Key Management&quot;">16</a>]).  If PSKs are tied to specific WTPs, then
   knowledge of the PSK implies a binding to a specified identity that
   can be authorized.

   If PSKs are shared, this binding between device and identity is no
   longer possible.  Compromise of one WTP can yield compromise of
   another WTP, violating the CAPWAP security hierarchy.  Consequently,
   sharing keys between WTPs is NOT RECOMMENDED.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-12.6" href="#section-12.6">12.6</a>.  Use of Certificates in CAPWAP</span>

   For public-key-based DTLS deployments, each device SHOULD have unique
   credentials, with an extended key usage authorizing the device to act
   as either a WTP or AC.  If devices do not have unique credentials, it
   is possible that by compromising one device, any other device using
   the same credential may also be considered to be compromised.

   Certificate validation involves checking a large variety of things.

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft        CAPWAP Protocol Specification            June 2007</span>


   Since the necessary things to validate are often environment-
   specific, many are beyond the scope of this document.  In this
   section, we provide some basic guidance on certificate validation.

   Each device is responsible for authenticating and authorizing devices
   with which they communicate.  Authentication entails validation of
   the chain of trust leading to the peer certificate, followed by the
   the peer certificate itself.  At a minimum, devices SHOULD use SSH-
   style certificate caching to guarantee consistency.  If devices have
   access to a certificate authority, they SHOULD properly validate the
   trust chain.  Implementations SHOULD also provide a secure method for
   verifying that the credential in question has not been revoked.

   Note that if the WTP relies on the AC for network connectivity (e.g.
   the AC is a layer 2 switch to which the WTP is directly connected),
   the WTP may not be able to contact an OCSP server or otherwise obtain
   an up to date CRL if a compromised AC doesn't explicitly permit this.
   This cannot be avoided, except through effective physical security
   and monitoring measures at the AC.

   Proper validation of certificates typically requires checking to
   ensure the certificate has not yet expired.  If devices have a real-
   time clock, they SHOULD verify the certificate validity dates.  If no
   real-time clock is available, the device SHOULD make a best-effort
   attempt to validate the certificate validity dates through other
   means.  Failure to check a certificate's temporal validity can make a
   device vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks launched using
   compromised, expired certificates, and therefore devices should make
   every effort to perform this validation.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-12.7" href="#section-12.7">12.7</a>.  AAA Security</span>

   The AAA protocol is used to distribute EAP keys to the ACs, and
   consequently its security is important to the overall system
   security.  When used with TLS or IPsec, security guidelines specified
   in <a href="./rfc3539">RFC 3539</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title="&quot;Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) Transport Profile&quot;">5</a>] SHOULD be followed.

   In general, the link between the AC and AAA server SHOULD be secured
   using a strong ciphersuite keyed with mutually authenticated session
   keys.  Implementations SHOULD NOT rely solely on Basic RADIUS shared
   secret authentication as it is often vulnerable to dictionary
   attacks, but rather SHOULD use stronger underlying security
   mechanisms.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-13" href="#section-13">13</a>.  Management Considerations</span>

   The CAPWAP protocol assumes that it is the only configuration
   interface to the WTP to configure parameters that are specified in
   the CAPWAP specifications.  While the use of a separate management
   protocol MAY be used for the purposes of monitoring the WTP directly,
   configuring the WTP through a separate management interface is not
   recommended.  Configuring the WTP through a separate protocol, such
   as via a CLI or SNMP, could lead to the AC state being out of sync
   with the WTP.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-14" href="#section-14">14</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   A separate UDP port for data channel communications is (currently)
   the selected demultiplexing mechanism, and a port must be assigned
   for this purpose in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.  The UDP port numbers are listed by
   IANA at <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers">http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers</a>.

   IANA needs to assign an organization local multicast address called
   the "All ACs multicast address" from the IPv6 multicast address
   registry in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-14.1" href="#section-14.1">14.1</a>.  CAPWAP Message Types</span>

   The Message Type field in the CAPWAP header (<a href="#section-4.5.1.1">Section 4.5.1.1</a>) is used
   to identify the operation performed by the message.  There are
   multiple namespaces, which is identified via the first three octets
   of the field containing the IANA Enterprise Number [<a href="#ref-10" title="&quot;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs&quot;">10</a>].  When the
   Enterprise Number is set to zero, the message types are reserved for
   use by the base CAPWAP specification which are controlled and
   maintained by IANA and requires a Standards Action.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-14.2" href="#section-14.2">14.2</a>.  Wireless Binding Identifiers</span>

   The Wireless Binding Identifier (WBID) field in the CAPWAP header
   (<a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>) is used to identify the wireless technology associated
   with the packet.  Due to the limited address space available, a new
   WBID request requires Standards Action.
