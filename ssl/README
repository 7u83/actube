Create ssl certificates to test AC-Tube and it's WTP
====================================================

1. Create a root CA by executing: 

   ./mkrootca

   This creates the files root-ca.crt and root-ca.key.


2. Create client certificates for AC and WTP

   ./mkcerts

   This will create the files ac.key, ac.crt and  wtp.crt, wtp.key. 
   All .key files are protected with  the password you have chosen 
   in the certificate creation process. 

3. Put these entries into  ac.conf  located in  the    ac directory, 
   so AC-Tube wilil use the certificates:

   ssl_key=../../ssl/ac.key
   ssl_key_pass=your password 
   ssl_cert=../../ssl/ac.crt

   For WTP the certiciate's config entries for now are hard-coded.
   Now you can play around joining WTP to AC...

4. If you want to connect a Cisco 1130 series LAP to  AC-Tube you 
   have to install the CA file on the LAP. Therofore you can create 
   a terminal script by  executing:

   ./mkciscoimport.sh 	

   Paste the result into a terminal session when in enabled mode. 

   To ac.conf add the following entry:
   
   dtls_verify_peer = no

   Now your Cisco 1130 LAP will join to AC-Tube. Remember that the 
   Cisco LAP will lose the installed  certificate after rebooting. 


If you experience with other Cisco LAPs (e.g. 1141), please tell me.
